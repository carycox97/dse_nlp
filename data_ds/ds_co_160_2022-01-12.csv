Both leverage the commander's singular vision and guidance; develop plans to meet challenges in the same strategic and operational environments; build complementary mission approaches; and share a common goal of defense of the United States and Canada.  Our competitors have analyzed our ability to operate overseas and have invested in capabilities such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, small unmanned aircraft systems, artificial intelligence, cyber capabilities, and delivery platforms to offset our strengths while exploiting our perceived weaknesses. These advancing capabilities embolden competitors and adversaries to challenge us at home, looking to threaten our people, our critical infrastructure and our power projection capabilities.  These challenges have generated a strong demand for not only changes in operations, but changes in the corresponding education and training programs supporting force employment, development, and design. You will join a team that performs analysis, assessment and integration in support of the Joint Training, Exercises, and Wargaming Directorate (N&NC/J7).

You will conduct data analysis of a variety of systems (some cloud based) to help develop business decision support tools.  You will apply engineering and/or analytical disciplines required to analyze real-world operational lessons-learned data resulting in recommended changes to training venues to mitigate identified shortfalls. You will further assist the team in identifying, assessing, experimenting, and testing solutions resulting from the studies and analyses accomplished to generate improvements in J7 managed programs and business processes.
