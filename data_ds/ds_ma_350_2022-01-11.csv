Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in America. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians (Groups), physician-enablement experts (VillageMD, Steward, Stellar) and technologists (athenahealth, TrialSpark, Flatiron Health) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to America's future health. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz and AlleyCorp.  We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare. We launched Pearl Health to help PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. This solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population and democratize access to healthcare risk, making it more readily available and optimized through an intelligent marketplace. We free physicians to better allocate their time with patients, increase their autonomy, and provide incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence.

You make use of best-of-breed experiment tracking systems to ensure that model performance is reproducible, observable, and debuggable.  You can't wait to combine your background with our unprecedented EEG dataset to blow published statistical EEG results out of the water.  You've developed a solid, heavily-exercised workflow for debugging model performance; you now know more about the limitations of automatic differentiation and distributed heterogeneous computing than you ever thought you would when you started your ML journey (e.g. ""How can I alter this model's architecture to mitigate the decrease in sample throughput once I lower the minibatch size?"").

This includes systems to detect very challenging threats, as well as radar imagery, and advanced countermeasures to degrade the performance of adversary radar systems. Lincoln Laboratory is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), whose core mission is technology in support of national security. As such, the role of the lab is to provide objective advice and to provide the best solutions to the government, not simply promoting our own systems. The group works at every stage of radar sensor development, from designing operational concepts with pen and paper studies to gathering real world data, developing novel processing techniques, building hardware prototypes, developing test plans, demonstrating real time operations and working with operational platforms to deploy new techniques in the field. This requires a team with a broad range of backgrounds, and our team includes scientists familiar with sensing systems, mathematicians who can develop algorithms, hardware engineers who can build RF systems. Our group seeks a diverse set of technical and non-technical backgrounds, emphasizing creative problem solving and a “design it – build it – test it” approach to radar challenges. Staff have opportunities to design and build end-to-end working systems and test those systems on one of our two aircraft testbeds. This position is ideal for mathematicians, engineers and scientists who have curiosity and a broad range of interest, and a talent for determining what really drives a problem. Lincoln Laboratory maintains a relatively flat structure, and staff are empowered to propose and run technical programs on their own initiative with support of management. Group staff solve the most challenging real world problems that have a direct impact on the Nation. We solve problems that really matter.   The Airborne Radar Systems and Techniques group is able to support all of these activities by our strong multidisciplinary teams. Staff at all levels are encouraged to develop and lead teams that enable us to leverage everyone’s unique skill set. The Airborne Radar Systems and Techniques group houses some of the top world experts in radar systems, including an IEEE president and several IEEE fellows, who work in an inclusive and supportive environment to bring great ideas into reality. Lincoln Laboratory’s collaborative atmosphere supports and rewards self-starters and curious individuals with creative approaches to some of the most difficult problems in the world, and this enables us to accomplish great things.  Position Description  The airborne radar systems and techniques group (group 105) is looking for staff to examine the intersection of machine learning and RF systems. We are seeking scientists, engineers and mathematicians with machine learning experience. Machine learning applications are expected to include reinforcement learning based radar design, use of machine learning to reproduce and surpass signal processing components, hybrid learning/signal processing approaches, and novel electronic warfare architectures leveraging machine learning, as well as computer vision tasks. Group 105 specializes in airborne applications of radar such as radar imaging, long range detection, bistatic radars, and electronic warfare (EW). We are a data driven multidisciplinary group, operating two radar testbeds and two EW testbeds. Prior experience with radar is not required, although some knowledge of wave theory and RF systems is a plus. The ideal candidate would have experience with novel applications of Convolutional Neural Networks, familiarity with Tensorflow or PyTorch and have experience with Python, as well as a background in working with scientific data and hardware systems. Group 105 has an inclusive and collaborative environment, with a strict open-door policy, where new staff are encouraged to seek the guidance and leverage the knowledge of more experienced staff around the group. Responsibilities include algorithm development, experimental design, machine learning data collection planning, and implementation and evaluation. We also encourage our staff to develop new approaches and ideas, especially in machine learning applications, and so creative problem solving and novel architecture development are also appreciated.   Position requirements: Doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics or related field. In lieu of a Doctoral degree, a Master's degree in the above areas with a minimum of 5 years of directly related radar or signal processing experience will be considered.
