https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=eb6643b8c1865765&from=web&vjs=3,10,Machine Learning for Data Assimilation,National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),"Greenbelt, MD","Organization  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Reference Code  0213-NPP-JUL22-GSFC-EarthSci Application Deadline  7/1/2022 6:00:00 PM Eastern Time Zone Description  In support of NASA’s Earth science missions, the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) maintains the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) weather prediction model. Multiple times a day, GEOS combines millions of real-time observations from around the globe with the billions of variables output from the model to produce the best guess of the atmospheric state. This monumental data science problem, known as data assimilation, presents a number of challenges: how to optimally combine all of the data in a physically sensible way, and how to assess the value of the information we have. There are numerous approaches to data assimilation, but adjoint-based techniques are used in the world’s leading forecast systems. As such, GMAO maintains an adjoint version of the GEOS model and uses it in several important data assimilation applications. However, adjoint model development can be a difficult process. It relies on a linearization of the model equations, many of which are nonlinear. In addition, the nonlinear model development progresses rapidly, and keeping the adjoint version in sync can be challenging; adjoint models must be extremely efficient, and automated generation (differentiation) tools are less helpful in this respect. Recently, two areas or research have arisen that can be applied to adjoint development to make it more streamlined. First is machine learning. In a machine learning approach, a neural network is trained to emulate the behavior of some component of the GEOS model. Once trained, the adjoint of that emulation would be readily available due to the inherent use of adjoints in neural network methodology. Neural network emulations are typically much faster than the model they emulate and can be trained again with relative ease as the underlying model changes. This makes them an appealing alternative for generating adjoint models. The second technology is the Local Ensemble Tangent Linear Models (LETLM), where an ensemble of model forecasts is used to generate the adjoint version of the model. Like a machine learning approach, this would eliminate the need to develop the adjoint model explicitly and would account for nonlinearity in the underlying system. A novel approach to adjoint development harnessing these techniques has the potential to unleash a new era of adjoint-based data assimilation and advance weather forecasting.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=437ba982373338af&from=web&vjs=3,40,Data Scientist- Multiple Levels,Red Alpha LLC,"Annapolis Junction, MD 20701","    Description:       A little about us:     The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.     Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.     Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.     A day in the life:     Despite the title of this role being “Data Engineer” (which sounds very specific), it is actually a great opportunity to demonstrate the diversity of your skills across the data science spectrum. From procurement, consolidation, and cleansing to modeling and presentation, you will influence and add value in several areas across the data science life cycle in order to answer mission and business questions. Subject areas include but are not limited to the following:         Employ a variety of languages and tools (e.g., scripting languages) to integrate systems.      Conduct research and leverage large volumes of data from multiple sources to answer mission and business questions.      Employ sophisticated analytics, programs, machine learning, and statistical methods to prepare data for use in analytical processes and prescriptive modeling.      Explore and examine data for hidden patterns.      Automate work through the use of predictive and prescriptive analytics.      Develop processes to extract/transform/load (ETL) data between different systems.     . Requirements:       What you bring to the table:     Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in.     All of our data scientists need the following skills:         Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python      Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.      A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.      For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.      For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.      For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.      A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance.        For this particular role, you will also need:         Experience in identifying, developing, and deploying new approaches to automate data collection, consolidation, and analysis      Proven ability to develop and deploy software and scripts needed to collect business-relevant metrics based on enterprise data        These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory:         Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues.      Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages      Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding)      Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop      Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting      Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React      Familiarity with Agile processes and structures, and able to work on a software development team        Why Red Alpha?     Every day, our elite customers are pushing through ""the grind"" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom. Rise to the occasion with us to deliver engineering excellence, to match their dedication to this nation. Join us as we  bring digital transformation to the fight.     Some of our perks and benefits:         You can retire sooner rather than planned:  Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions.      You can have a career AND a life:  Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (25 days of personal time off) and 10 paid holidays (all of which we treat as floaters).      You can stay at your best:  As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family.      Free access to a fully equipped state of the art gym!      $300 per year in company branded merchandise (Under Armour, Nike, Carhartt, YETI, etc.)      Fun events throughout the year including a holiday gala, whisky tastings, fall festivals, happy hours, and more.
