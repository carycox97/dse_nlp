Employees across the company are building toward the strategic vision - improving the quality of the product, engagement with our platform, creating and evolving experiences: for Pinners to browse, save, and shop, for Creators to build, for Advertisers to reach their customers. They build and refine these ideas, evaluate them and launch when it's beneficial to do so. But what if every person in the company could realize 10 times the impact they have today, by testing more ideas, getting feedback faster, and learning how to make each idea more impactful? That's the goal of the Data Platforms Science team.  Using Pinterest's Machine Learning platform, engineers train about 10,000 models each week and deploy hundreds of these to production. We have tools to collect human labels on hundreds of thousands of questions each week and use these to create training sets, compare the performance of models, or evaluate the state of our product.

Can we predict the gains seen in online A/B tests?  Can we collect 10x fewer training labels and achieve the same model performance?  Evolve our machine learning, human evaluation, and in-app survey strategy  in close partnership with product and engineering leaders by building on the learnings uncovered by your team and shaping the infrastructure necessary to collect the data needed at scale   What we're looking for:   10+ years of combined post-graduate academic and industry experience applying scientific methods to solve real-world problems on web-scale data 2+ years experience managing and up-leveling other data scientists or product analysts  Demonstrated execution and impact on cross-functional initiatives, strong communication skills, and a track record of influencing leaders and peers using data  Self-propelled continuous learner who keeps up with new tools and methodologies and builds prototypes with concepts learned  Expertise in machine learning and at least one scripting language (ideally Python)  Strong business and product sense who can shape vague questions into well-defined analyses and success metrics that drive business decisions  The best candidates will also have:  Strong focus on understanding opportunities to improve the performance of ML training or evaluation and examples working with human-labeled data.
