And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.  We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys.
