Some families can get needed resources for their children, while others cannot for a variety of reasons. The Get Ready Guilford Initiative (GRGI) charts a new vision that will offer all families universal screening to connect them to the right resources at the right time. The goal of the initiative is for families of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers to get the resources and services they need and when they need them, so every child enters school ready to succeed. GRGI is implementing prenatal and postnatal universal navigation visits with volunteering pregnant women to learn about the process, the screening tools, and integration with pregnancy care managers (OBCM). GRGI has worked with local and state partners to develop a plan to pilot a universal approach to prenatal and postnatal screening. In Durham, in collaboration with our colleagues in Guilford County, our team at the Center for Child and Family Policy (CCFP) and Duke Children’s Primary Care (DCPC) is overseeing a randomized control trial to assess the impact of prenatal and postnatal navigation. This work includes building an understanding of the existing programs and services in the prenatal and postnatal space; implementing and evaluating universal approach, screening for individual needs of families, and referral to community resources; identifying questions or challenges to implementing this process and solutions to these challenges; and developing documentation for consent, data sharing, and follow-up contacts.  Responsibilities: Coordinate and participate in a variety of duties to assist investigators in the implementation of the research study. Screen, recruit and obtain informed consent from families to participate in the study. Participate in scheduling family interviews via email, phone, text, as well as letter and/or in-person scheduling when required. This will require time in the field as well as use of internet-based databases when family contact information is no longer valid. Organizing and conducting phone, video, in-home, and web-based family interviews. Duties will include scheduling visits, conducting interviews, administering standardized assessments, and recording interview responses when required. Completing interview data entry via tablet computer and appropriately manage data transfer when required. Maintain accurate and up-to-date records of families’ participation status and scheduling calendar. Prepare and maintain files of research materials. Prepare and type related correspondence, operate office machines as required. Attend and contribute to project meetings and other meetings held at CCFP and DCPC as appropriate. Engage directly with project leadership regarding project deliverables, continuous quality improvement efforts, etc. Contribute to the ongoing collection of administrative records and the writing of project technical reports as needed.
