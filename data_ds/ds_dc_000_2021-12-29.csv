Come join our collaborative team at Data Tecnica International (DTI) by supporting two great labs at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Stroke (NINDS, Ward and Levine labs). This opportunity focuses on aiding with data processing, management and analysis of dynamic cellular data in the contexts of both cellular and animal models. The minimal qualifications of the candidate is a US citizen (or work permit holder) with some experience in bioinformatics, high performance computing, python programming and a basic knowledge of genomics. Ideally, a master’s degree in bioinformatics, neural computation, computational biology or biomedical data science would be best. This position is open immediately. This position is remote for the duration of at least one year, commensurate with ~1300 hours of work estimated for the calendar year. Please see below for a comprehensive outline of potential duties, responsibilities and background on the collaborative labs. If interested, please send: CV, recommendation contact information and a GitHub link or other code example to info@datatecnica.com. Levine Lab Data Types : All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form. Mouse behavior Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc. Cellular activity (post-hoc): Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers Cellular activity (dynamic): Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the broader population of recorded cells Levine Lab Analysis Goals : Data analysis: Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar) Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position) Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions Recording from different populations of neurons Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types Different behavioral/motivational contexts Developmental age Spinal cord injury Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration Data Modeling: Physical forces/torques/biomechanics Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys) Dynamical systems modeling Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration Levine Lab SOW : Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing. The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative. Levine Lab Background : The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury. To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery. Ward Lab Data Types : Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint Ward Lab Analysis Goals : Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets. Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets) Ward Lab SOW Data analysis (as above) The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI) Ward Lab   Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI: Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible. Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions. Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI. Ward Lab background : The Ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We exclusively use genetically-modified human iPSCs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. iPSCs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. Almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.",30+ days ago,

As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems. Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed and would love to share it with you. Our process can be a little bit different from some other companies; we tend to hire data scientists slowly, after we have gotten to know people a little bit, and this job posting is the mechanism for initiating that process. Most of our recent hires were the product of ongoing conversations that resulted in a formal fit when the timing was right for both of us. This does mean we sometimes miss out on potential hires, but we believe there are a lot of good people out there; we are willing to wait not only for the right person, but also for the right timing. It has been a successful recipe so far. . Requirements: What you bring to the table: Now on to the fun of formal requirements-we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. You will need: A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field. For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 3 years of experience managing teams. For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on data science projects. A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance. A bit more informally, though, you should have experience with Python, R, Hadoop, Spark, Random Forests, Deterministic Forests (jk), Jupyter Notebooks, xkcd, Deep Learning, and a host of other tools and techniques: you do not need to know them all, but you should be comfortable and capable with quite a few of them. You might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. Why Red Alpha? A few of our perks and benefits: You can retire sooner rather than planned:  Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions. You can have a career AND a life:  Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (up to 25 days of personal time off) and 10 paid holidays. You can stay at your best:  As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family.

About The Role and Project All of the Federal Marketplace (FMP) and Digital Experience (DX) initiatives require extensive data management, analysis and normalization. FAS has made great strides in the past two years by bringing key data into a FAS Enterprise Data Architecture (EDA) with a data set catalog. In order to bring data into the EDA, data scientists/analysts need to normalize data across multiple systems and sync up data fields to ensure the EDA holds clean, authoritative data that can be used by all of FAS. A good amount of FAS’s data is still held on 30 year old legacy production systems. Often, these data sources do not have similar data elements or the field names are not clear for data consumers. More current data sources such as “prices paid” data are reported in inconsistent formats and are in need of data standards. In order to create unified digital tools for FAS schedule customers, disparate data sources must be painstakingly combined into a unified data structure. Existing data science capabilities within GSA are at or over capacity with demand from across the enterprise. The outcomes of this process will: Increase data quality Enhances data integrity for the Digital Experience (DX) project Provide faster delivery of quality data to customers in support of unpriced services Support TDR expansion and improve the useability and usage of TDR data The Fine Print: Expected travel 0-10%; may increase based on business needs This is an exempt, full-time position Censeo offers a competitive compensation and benefits package, including paid vacation and sick leave, flexible and remote work opportunities, and tuition and training reimbursement.

Who You Are:   You have a proven track record using data-driven solutions to improve social outcomes - and bring a multidisciplinary approach to doing so.

You are experienced deriving value from imperfect data, but also know when to pull the emergency stop button.   We’re not building a team for a day—this is a project for the long haul.

You may also have experience:   Leading a project in which you (and possibly also your team) led a client from the point of analysis to change in behavior - whether internal or external to the organization.  Helping more junior analysts take their work from 80% to done: maybe by quality checking results, adding context, or helping to organize raw analysis into stories and recommendations.  Experience developing solutions that blend data-driven decision-making with thoughtful understanding of human-centered design/processes.  Authoring narrative and data visualizations that were tailored to engage your client at the right level of detail.  Guiding significant aspects of larger projects that aim to achieve key objectives, using your strong understanding of the organization’s end goal and with minimal direct supervision.

We work with humility and a spirit of service. We serve a mission that is bigger than ourselves, and we recognize that we cannot do this work alone. We foster a caring community of mutual support, and we actively pursue collaborations and partnerships to expand our reach. Victims’ and survivors’ experiences ground our efforts. We honor the dignity, agency, and resilience of victims and survivors of slavery, both past and present. We serve, work alongside, and stand in solidarity with those who have been most affected by modern slavery. We strive for inclusion and equity. We engage different perspectives to inform our decisions, actions, and positions. We create opportunities that empower individuals of diverse backgrounds and circumstances.

We recognize that what is typical or traditional is not always optimal. We create positive impact and achieve results.

We view impact holistically, considering multiple sectors and the effects on individuals’ lives, as we pursue systemic and social change to eradicate modern slavery. DIVERSITY STATEMENT:  Polaris designs and implements data-driven strategies to prevent and disrupt human trafficking, and restore freedom to survivors. Achieving this ambitious goal requires both trafficking-specific systemic interventions and broader cultural and structural shifts that reduce the inequities that lead to human trafficking. While Polaris alone cannot build a more diverse, just, equitable, and inclusive society, both the success of our work and our organizational values require modeling in the workplace the change we want to see in the world. This means cultivating a workforce, organizational culture, and priorities that respect and celebrate a dynamic, multi-disciplinary team made up of individuals with different identities, lived experiences, and backgrounds. Within both our team and across every part of our work, we strive to integrate and elevate the full range of survivor voices. This is a living commitment. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are values to be manifested daily, in the work we do, the decisions we make, and the way that we treat each other and the people we seek to serve. This means creating space where staff can be included, heard, valued, and set up for success, and where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, best selves to work. We will not check boxes and consider it done. We will push new innovations and different ways of thinking, and treasure the community built and strengthened by each of our contributions.

Working at the WBG Group (WBG) provides a unique opportunity for you to help our clients solve their greatest development challenges. The WBG is one of the largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries; a unique global partnership of five institutions dedicated to ending extreme poverty, increasing shared prosperity, and promoting sustainable development. With 189 member countries and more than 120 offices worldwide, we work with public and private sector partners, investing in groundbreaking projects and using data, research, and technology to develop solutions to the most urgent global challenges. For more information, visit www.worldbank.org.  The WBG sees the closing of key gaps between men and women, and expansion of voice/agency for women and girls as critical to its goals of eliminating poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The WBG has made large strides in addressing these issues over the past 20 years. Under International Development Association (IDA) 18, as well as with the recent capital increase, the WBG has committed to an ambitious corporate push on new targets and strategic frontiers, and the current WBG gender strategy commits Regions and Global Practices to draw on strong, evidence-based gender analysis to inform policy and program priorities. The WBG seeks stronger and better-resourced efforts to address gender inequalities in human development, access to good jobs and control over productive assets, and services that meet the needs of both women and men, especially the poorest, and focus also on areas that could have transformational impacts. More and better data is required to contribute to policy dialogue and provide a solid evidence base for policies on gender equality. This is reinforced by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which require sex-disaggregated data to track progress towards all goals, including SDG 5 on gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. The WBG Group is scaling up commitments and expanding partnerships to improve the collection, access and use of gender data, with emphasis on economic empowerment, such as data related to work, ownership of assets, and financial inclusion. Position context There are activities related to addressing gender data gaps across the WBG. Among these are include investment project financing for statistics which make major investments in the activities of national statistical organizations (NSOs) and their partner entities. Among other activities, these projects often target the collection of household surveys to improve upon the availability of sex-disaggregated data, as well as additional data sets that will strengthen the economic and social statistics of these countries. As such, they are a core investment by the WBG towards closing gender gaps in national statistical systems. In support of this operational work, the project “ Strengthening Gender Statistics ” (SGS) is an initiative to narrow gender data gaps, especially those related to economic status and outcomes, for at least 10 partner countries, by providing technical assistance to NSOs on their data production systems, following international standards and guidance. This project is a collaboration between the WBG Gender Group, Poverty and Inequality Global Practice, Development Data Group’s Living Standards Measurement Study and the Indicators and Data Services team.   The project provides targeted technical assistance on upcoming face-to-face, phone, or internet-based surveys and censuses with partner national statistics offices to improve the production of gender data in a strategic and targeted manner. The project also supports the production of guidance material so this work can be replicated to other countries, in addition to the actual closing of data gaps in partner countries. It works in close collaboration with operational colleagues. Additional support to NSOs comes under the direction of the Household Survey Working Group (co-chaired by Poverty GP and DECDG’s Living Standards Measurement Study team, where gender is one of the themes of the review of upcoming national household survey questionnaires. It is a key approach to scaling-up important questionnaire design improvements to fill gender data gaps. Third, as part of the WBG’s gender strategy, the WBG maintains a Gender Data Portal: https://www.worldbank.org/en/data/datatopics/gender which is the WBG’s comprehensive open data source for historical and current data broken down by sex.

Data can be viewed in tables, charts, and maps or downloaded in one of several open formats. The Gender Data Portal is one of the most popular data platforms and the “go to” place for reliable data broken down by sex. The portal has recently been revamped to expand the scope and impact of the Gender Data Portal by making the data more accessible to a larger audience through data stories and visualizations. In addition, the Gender Data Portal is a repository for the latest methodological guidelines on well-designed surveys to improve gender data (including related to phone surveys).
