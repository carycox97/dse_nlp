Our data scientists work with key business leaders and decision makers to solve problems by mining, analyzing, and modeling data to provide insights that drive change. The day-to-day includes exploratory analysis to understand data structures and relationships, working closely with our business partners to build insight into new problems, research to refine a methodology, cranking out lightning-fast machine learning code to create a model that predicts trends and automates validation, collaborating with cross-functional teams, or visualizing and sharing their results with executives. Our work as innovators means that we are approaching new problems on novel (and potentially unstable) data and there is no playbook for best practice; instead, we rely on our mathematical intuition and industry knowledge of trends in Customer behavior to resolve tension between complexity, scope, and explainability.  Our analysts are comfortable working with a variety of partners and data (structured, unstructured, streaming) in a shared code repository utilizing multiple programming languages and frameworks to deliver state-of-the-art analytics and models in an agile environment. The team is obsessed with our customers, financial projections, data science, research, AI, programming, clean and powerful data visualizations to communicate our ideas, and collaborating to find the best approach to emerging questions.  Who you are  We are looking for a passionate and innovative individual to join our Channel Analytics and Data Science team this year as we expand our inquiry using advanced and alternative analytics. You are skilled in research methods, data analytics, and statistics. You have a proven record (in academia or industry) of tackling difficult questions with new and creative ideas. You are a chameleon: you explain your processes in different ways to different people while maintaining the honesty and integrity of your ideas. You are logical and structured in your thinking and are fluent in at least one programming language and framework (Python, C++, R, SQL, Julia, Scala). You have a passion for clear communication and have built some stunning charts and visualizations in the past which told a very important story. You are empathetic and in tune with what makes the world go around, connecting abstract modelling to drivers of human behaviors in banking or a related field (healthcare, economics, ecommerce, digital, psychology, life sciences). You love being part of a fast-moving team and welcome feedback to learn. You are organized and able to document what you produce. You are not afraid to ask questions and seek answers in a self-determined manner. You are comfortable with ambiguity and charting a path through quantitative analysis. You are committed to making the world a better place and can adhere to our corporate culture and values.   Examples of potential work  Much of the work will be acting as an internal consultant within the broader analytics center of excellence, engaging in a range of projects for various departments throughout the bank. This could include, for example, creating proof of concept work on unstructured data, working to understand customer behavior and key drivers of customer satisfaction in real-time, or aiming to answer questions that are difficult to define and measure. One day you might be fitting distributions to historical data and modelling extreme future events, the next helping colleagues find anomalies in their data indicative of maleficent intent. Through it all, you will draw upon your well-stocked toolkit of mathematical understanding and coding skills, and an openness to collaborate to create new methodologies.  Role and responsibilities  Investigate, define, and iterate with business partners to define business problems and data science use cases  Develop new approaches as needed to quantify emerging risks and opportunities  Create, implement, and validate machine learning models including rigorous documentation of code and results  Communicate in person, via email, over teleconference, and in virtual meetings with internal and external team members  Mine and manipulate data from disparate systems and environments  Use statistics to analyze data and produce insights on tight timelines  Work as part of a team and collaborate across groups  Problem solve on varied and concurrent projects, self-organize your work and projects (with input on prioritizing from team leader)  Present materials (visual, verbal) to relevant parties about data science concepts, data architectures, and model results  A desire to share findings, methodologies, etc. and contribute to the literature through internal white papers and peer reviewed publications   Technical Skills  Honed application of the research process – exploration, hypothesis creation, and iteration  Experience using data science methodologies including regression, time-series, classification, recommender systems, or NLP  Deep understanding of statistics or advanced mathematics like Bayesian inference, optimization, linear algebra  Fluency in at least one machine learning programming language and framework (R, Python, C, C++, Julia, Scala)  Comfort mining and manipulate data in SQL or SAS  Ability to explain failures as well as successes as you build understanding in an emerging area   At Santander, we value and respect differences in our workforce and strive to increase the diversity of our teams.

The NEFSC Protected Species Branch (PSB) mission includes evaluating threats to species and populations due to anthropogenic activities. The Machine Learning Image Recognition Analyst will be working on protected species bycatch, which is when protected animals get caught or entangled in fishing gear. Bycatch can negatively affect species such as dolphins, sea turtles, protected fish, and whales by harming animals, contributing to population declines, and impeding population recovery. For this project, video data that was collected on commercial fishing vessels as part of a fisheries monitoring program is being reviewed so that bycatch events and species can be identified and further analyzed. Since such interactions are relatively rare events, these data are sparse and an automated review of the video can be a realistic and cost effective way to identify actual or probable protected species interactions. The Machine Learning Image Recognition Analyst will develop analyses of image data to inform bycatch estimates and assessments of fisheries impacts on protected species. The Analyst’s ultimate goal is to develop an algorithm automating the detection and identification of protected species visualized on video from gillnet, bottom trawl, and other types of fishing gear. The Machine Learning Image Recognition Analyst will begin by curating and developing a protected species (bird, mammal, turtle) image library utilizing video and still image data sets. After that, the Analyst will explore approaches to automating image analysis, developing algorithms in support of machine learning applications and annotated training data sets. Duties Gaining familiarity with the data and processes, including image review, data analysis, image data set curation, preparing and processing data. Identifying, acquiring and/or generating, and characterizing data and annotations. Investigating and determining suitable machine learning technologies and available open-source resources (software applications, coding, and curated datasets) for a data-sparse context. Training and testing models. Developing machine learning based video analysis; creating a system and workflow for conducting the automated image analysis. Generating reports that use the image data to inform assessments of fisheries impacts on protected species. Qualifications and Skills BS in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, or a closely related field. Deep proficiency in at least one programming language relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence for image recognition (VIAME, TensorFlow, Python, R, Matlab, C++, etc.) Demonstrated skill and knowledge in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to image data for image recognition. Experience in photogrammetry and information extraction using machine learning, deep neural nets for image recognition. Project development and management skills are desirable. Statistical programming skills are desirable. Coursework and/or exposure to biological data is desired, but not required. The skills needed are in programming, not biology. US citizenship and presence. Ability to comply with EO 14042. Excellent written and oral communication skills. Track record of success in working remotely. Demonstrated ability to contribute timely deliverables and work collaboratively as part of a team. The position is expected to be full-time for one year, the rate of pay depends on skills and experience, and the position is eligible for the benefits described on the Integrated Statistics website. The position will probably start remotely but with the goal of intermittent in-person work at the NEFSC lab in Woods Hole, MA.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.  From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the team  At Roku, the Data Science team lives and works on a kind of frontier: We get called in for things that haven't been done before. This requires meaningful collaboration with the platform team, the firmware team and even the finance team to prove or disprove new product ideas. Often the idea evolves from what was first proposed until it is a wholly new thing that gets shipped. No one here is ashamed to present their latest work, and you'll find yourself pitching ideas to others in the company, including to executives.  Beyond collaboration, we seek builders with the persistence to keep pushing. Because we spend our time making prototypes and testing brand new ideas on systems with a lot of moving parts, we are faced with failures every day. The only way to really make something work is to really dig into the reasons and understand why. We value the grit and persistence it takes to keep just trying.  About the role  Roku pioneered TV streaming and continues to innovate and lead the industry. The Roku Channel has us well-positioned to help shape the future of streaming. Continued success relies on investing in Data Science and diving deep into the economics of our business.  This role is right for you if you value impact. You will be researching and solving complex AI problems and then working closely with Machine Learning engineers to automate this process to prove it out at scale. You will influence the direction of Roku's strategic goals, question the inherent assumptions in our thinking, and define business objectives in an innovative and encouraging environment.  The ideal candidate will have endless curiosity and can pair a global mindset with locally relevant execution. You should be a gritty problem solver and self-starter who can drive programs with the product teams within Roku and across external strategic partner organizations. The successful candidate will display a balance of hard and soft skills, including the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.  What you'll be doing  Research and develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms to improve user experience on Roku's platform.  Develop economic models (e.g., market design, pricing, program evaluation, and forecasting) to better understand the user experience on Roku's platform.  Run live experiments to prototype the improvements and prove their efficacy.  Assist the ML engineering teams with productization of successful algorithms, ensuring your work continues to drive value at scale.  Provide expert consultative assistance on AI to other teams in the company, including research data scientists working in other areas of Roku's stack, and provide technical feedback on their econometric work.  Contribute to the technical vision of the Research Data Science team.  We're excited if you have  PhD Degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Operations Research, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, or similar quantitative field with a solid understanding of ML.  Experience in causal Machine Learning and experimentation.  Proven problem solving and analytical abilities with solid software development skills in Python and SQL.  Experience in creating and integrating AI solutions with a smaller resource footprint at the hardware level.  Experience with TB or PB size datasets and Spark preferred.  Nice-to-have's include knowledge of user behavior in subscription and advertising-based video, auctions and/or advertising.  The Roku culture  Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.  We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in America. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians (Groups), physician-enablement experts (VillageMD, Steward, Stellar) and technologists (athenahealth, TrialSpark, Flatiron Health) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to America's future health. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz and AlleyCorp.  We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare. We launched Pearl Health to help PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. This solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population and democratize access to healthcare risk, making it more readily available and optimized through an intelligent marketplace. We free physicians to better allocate their time with patients, increase their autonomy, and provide incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence.  What we hope you can do...  We are seeking a brilliant Data Scientist with a track record of propeling business strategies through analytical insights and algorithmic systems.
