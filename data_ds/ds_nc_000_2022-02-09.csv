The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country. What the EPA project is about The Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) supports ORD by providing solutions-driven research to rapidly evaluate the potential human health and environmental risks due to exposures to environmental stressors and ensure the integrity of the freshwater environment and its capacity to support human well-being. CCTE researchers are developing and applying cutting edge innovations in methods to rapidly evaluate chemical toxicity, transport, and exposure to people and environments. Within CCTE, the Chemical Characterization and Exposure Division (CCED) performs research to develop and advance analytical chemistry, computational chemistry, and cheminformatic approaches that are critical to the rapid characterization of the presence, structural characteristics, and properties of chemicals that underlie chemical exposure, environmental fate, toxicokinetics and toxicity.  What experience and skills will you gain? As a team member, you will support research under the Chemical Safety for Sustainability (CSS) research program on enhancing the Generalized Read-across (GenRA) workflow to address other similarity contexts beyond structural similarity.  Read-across is a data gap filling technique used within analogue and category approaches where information on a (source) substance is used to infer the same property for a similar (target) substance. Read-across approaches are traditionally expert driven subjective assessments and as such it is difficult to quantify their performance. The Generalized Read-across (GenRA) approach developed and published in 2016 (Shah et al., 2016) aimed to investigate new ways of performing objective read-across predictions from which a baseline in performance could be quantified. GenRA has since been implemented as a webtool GenRA within the EPA Chemicals CompTox Dashboard (Helman et al., 2019). This work has been an ongoing collaboration between 2 divisions within CCTE leveraging the advances in computational toxicological data such as high throughput screening, high throughput transcriptomic and high throughput phenotypic profiling (so-called New Approach Methodologies (NAM) data) in conjunction with chemistry knowledge to make  in vivo  toxicity predictions. The current research focus on GenRA is to evaluate the contribution of NAM data to characterize different similarity contexts and their role in informing  in vivo  toxicity predictions. The GenRA approach involves using a fingerprint representation of a substance (either chemical or NAM based) and using it to identify ‘similar’ substances with associated toxicity data to make a read-across prediction. You will further develop the GenRA approach to evaluate other NAM data and develop prototypes to implement the insights derived.   Location:   This job will be located EPA’s facility in Research Triangle Park, NC.
