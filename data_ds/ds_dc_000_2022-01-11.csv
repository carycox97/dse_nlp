The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission.Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information).Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country.Description of PositionNSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals.Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability.The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in:- Signals analysis- Data compression- Machine learning- Data science- Human language technology- Speech/image/video processing- Analysis of communication networks- Network vulnerability analysis- CybersecurityAdditionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively. Job Summary NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals to collaborate in both long and short term work to solve mission-critical problems. To solve the problems generated by NSA's mission, mathematicians draw from a wide body of mathematical knowledge, including number theory, abstract algebra, graph theory, combinatorics, analysis, probability, statistics and more. However, the essential ingredient to the solution of a problem is often not mathematical knowledge per se, but the keen analytic ability that a mathematician possesses through training and talent.

Please see below for a comprehensive outline of potential duties, responsibilities and background on the collaborative labs. If interested, please send: CV, recommendation contact information and a GitHub link or other code example to info@datatecnica.com. Levine Lab Data Types : All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form. Mouse behavior Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc. Cellular activity (post-hoc): Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers Cellular activity (dynamic): Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the broader population of recorded cells Levine Lab Analysis Goals : Data analysis: Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar) Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position) Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions Recording from different populations of neurons Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types Different behavioral/motivational contexts Developmental age Spinal cord injury Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration Data Modeling: Physical forces/torques/biomechanics Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys) Dynamical systems modeling Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration Levine Lab SOW : Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing. The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative. Levine Lab Background : The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury. To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery. Ward Lab Data Types : Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint Ward Lab Analysis Goals : Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets. Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets) Ward Lab SOW Data analysis (as above) The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI) Ward Lab   Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI: Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible. Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions. Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI. Ward Lab background : The Ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We exclusively use genetically-modified human iPSCs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. iPSCs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. Almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.",30+ days ago,

We foster a caring community of mutual support, and we actively pursue collaborations and partnerships to expand our reach. Victims’ and survivors’ experiences ground our efforts. We honor the dignity, agency, and resilience of victims and survivors of slavery, both past and present. We serve, work alongside, and stand in solidarity with those who have been most affected by modern slavery. We strive for inclusion and equity. We engage different perspectives to inform our decisions, actions, and positions. We create opportunities that empower individuals of diverse backgrounds and circumstances.

We view impact holistically, considering multiple sectors and the effects on individuals’ lives, as we pursue systemic and social change to eradicate modern slavery. DIVERSITY STATEMENT:  Polaris designs and implements data-driven strategies to prevent and disrupt human trafficking, and restore freedom to survivors. Achieving this ambitious goal requires both trafficking-specific systemic interventions and broader cultural and structural shifts that reduce the inequities that lead to human trafficking. While Polaris alone cannot build a more diverse, just, equitable, and inclusive society, both the success of our work and our organizational values require modeling in the workplace the change we want to see in the world. This means cultivating a workforce, organizational culture, and priorities that respect and celebrate a dynamic, multi-disciplinary team made up of individuals with different identities, lived experiences, and backgrounds. Within both our team and across every part of our work, we strive to integrate and elevate the full range of survivor voices. This is a living commitment. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are values to be manifested daily, in the work we do, the decisions we make, and the way that we treat each other and the people we seek to serve. This means creating space where staff can be included, heard, valued, and set up for success, and where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, best selves to work. We will not check boxes and consider it done. We will push new innovations and different ways of thinking, and treasure the community built and strengthened by each of our contributions.

You will work on a fast-paced, impact-driven project team charged with intelligently improving the operations powering the policies and programs that hundreds of millions of Americans interact with on a daily basis. Our work builds the frameworks and infrastructure that allows agencies to deal with big public health challenges. We bring definition to challenging problems, creatively identify data sources, then design analytics that accurately measure impact and move the needle every day. We work in changing, ambiguous environments, so we embrace nuance, inclusivity, and complexity to deliver programs that work for the diverse groups of individuals who rely on us.   Who You Are:   You have a proven track record using data-driven solutions to improve social outcomes - and bring a multidisciplinary approach to doing so.  You apply variety of skills: whether thinking strategically about how to develop an enduring process, digging deep into a complex data analysis, or putting yourself in the shoes of an end-user to answer a question they didn’t know they had - you’re comfortable thinking from a number of different perspectives  You are able to anticipate questions from your stakeholders while remaining objective in how you approach their unique challenges. You are experienced deriving value from imperfect data, but also know when to pull the emergency stop button.   We’re not building a team for a day—this is a project for the long haul. More than anything else, we’re looking for people who are excited by our mission, love to create, are honest about what they know, fascinated by what they don’t, and relish the opportunity to work with people who value the same.   In this position you will:   Conduct and supervise analysis on data from disparate data sources to distill human-centered operations and processes into meaningful insights or evaluate and improve the effectiveness of large-scale healthcare related directly addressable (email, SMS, autodial, etc) outreach campaigns.  Drive data analysis and data management strategies to create systematic methods of measuring performance across complex systems and technical implementations.  Develop KPIs and metrics that address root problems and develop compelling visualizations to allow clients to easily understand challenges and take a clear action.  Check, clean and transform incoming data for data pipelines, and help others to do the same.  Collaborate with engineers, data scientists, program managers and external stakeholders to troubleshoot problems and proactively create solutions.  Strive to support team excellence by developing high quality documentation.  Work both independently and as part of a team to deliver accurate products on short deadlines.   You probably have:   Advanced understanding of how to manipulate data using SQL or Python.  Significant proficiency in one or more general or statistical programming languages (i.e. Python, Ruby or R) to systematically solve problems, and interest in learning new tools and techniques.  Significant experience creating repeatable data transformation processes.  Experience going from insight to impact: using the results of your analysis to tell a story through visualization, presentation, and writing.  3-4+ years of work experience working with structured/unstructured data.   You may also have experience:   Leading a project in which you (and possibly also your team) led a client from the point of analysis to change in behavior - whether internal or external to the organization.  Helping more junior analysts take their work from 80% to done: maybe by quality checking results, adding context, or helping to organize raw analysis into stories and recommendations.  Experience developing solutions that blend data-driven decision-making with thoughtful understanding of human-centered design/processes.  Authoring narrative and data visualizations that were tailored to engage your client at the right level of detail.  Guiding significant aspects of larger projects that aim to achieve key objectives, using your strong understanding of the organization’s end goal and with minimal direct supervision.  An undergraduate degree in a quantitative field or equivalent technical training. Conducting writing, testing, and implementing algorithmic modeling or machine learning work product to inform strategic decision-making for a client or organization.

As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems. Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed and would love to share it with you. Our process can be a little bit different from some other companies; we tend to hire data scientists slowly, after we have gotten to know people a little bit, and this job posting is the mechanism for initiating that process. Most of our recent hires were the product of ongoing conversations that resulted in a formal fit when the timing was right for both of us. This does mean we sometimes miss out on potential hires, but we believe there are a lot of good people out there; we are willing to wait not only for the right person, but also for the right timing. It has been a successful recipe so far. . Requirements: What you bring to the table: Now on to the fun of formal requirements-we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. You will need: A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field. For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 3 years of experience managing teams. For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on data science projects. A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance. A bit more informally, though, you should have experience with Python, R, Hadoop, Spark, Random Forests, Deterministic Forests (jk), Jupyter Notebooks, xkcd, Deep Learning, and a host of other tools and techniques: you do not need to know them all, but you should be comfortable and capable with quite a few of them. You might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. Why Red Alpha? A few of our perks and benefits: You can retire sooner rather than planned:  Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions. You can have a career AND a life:  Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (up to 25 days of personal time off) and 10 paid holidays. You can stay at your best:  As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family.
