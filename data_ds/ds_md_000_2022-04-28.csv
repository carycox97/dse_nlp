Multiple times a day, GEOS combines millions of real-time observations from around the globe with the billions of variables output from the model to produce the best guess of the atmospheric state. This monumental data science problem, known as data assimilation, presents a number of challenges: how to optimally combine all of the data in a physically sensible way, and how to assess the value of the information we have. There are numerous approaches to data assimilation, but adjoint-based techniques are used in the world’s leading forecast systems. As such, GMAO maintains an adjoint version of the GEOS model and uses it in several important data assimilation applications. However, adjoint model development can be a difficult process. It relies on a linearization of the model equations, many of which are nonlinear. In addition, the nonlinear model development progresses rapidly, and keeping the adjoint version in sync can be challenging; adjoint models must be extremely efficient, and automated generation (differentiation) tools are less helpful in this respect. Recently, two areas or research have arisen that can be applied to adjoint development to make it more streamlined. First is machine learning. In a machine learning approach, a neural network is trained to emulate the behavior of some component of the GEOS model. Once trained, the adjoint of that emulation would be readily available due to the inherent use of adjoints in neural network methodology. Neural network emulations are typically much faster than the model they emulate and can be trained again with relative ease as the underlying model changes. This makes them an appealing alternative for generating adjoint models. The second technology is the Local Ensemble Tangent Linear Models (LETLM), where an ensemble of model forecasts is used to generate the adjoint version of the model. Like a machine learning approach, this would eliminate the need to develop the adjoint model explicitly and would account for nonlinearity in the underlying system. A novel approach to adjoint development harnessing these techniques has the potential to unleash a new era of adjoint-based data assimilation and advance weather forecasting.

If you have questions, send an email to ORISE.FDA.CDER@orau.org. Please include the reference code for this opportunity in your email.  Application Deadline  8/31/2022 3:00:00 PM Eastern Time Zone Description  Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.  A research opportunity is available with the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality (OPQ)/ Office of New Drug Products (ONDP) in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Silver Spring, Maryland. CDER performs an essential public health task by making sure that safe and effective drugs are available to improve the health of people in the United States. As part of the FDA, CDER regulates over-the-counter and prescription drugs, including biological therapeutics and generic drugs. This work covers more than just medicines.  This project will serve to better understand the unique chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) challenges associated with 505(b2) submissions through data-mining deficiencies identified during 505(b2) assessment. A 505(b2) application is a new drug application (NDA) described in section 505(b2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A 505(b2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.  The goal of the project is to understand the unique CMC challenges associated with 505(b2) submissions through data-mining deficiencies identified during 505(b2) CMC assessment, conduct root cause investigations and propose mitigation plans to address common deficiencies. By doing that, OPQ/ONDP could provide general advice to sponsors/applicants at earlier development stages to address common deficiencies. This could lead to more efficient drug development and more first cycle approvals of 505(b2) applications with less agency inquiries during the review cycle.  Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will conduct data mining of investigational new drug applications (IND) and NDA submissions. The participant will learn current regulations, policy, and guidance related to different types of drug applications from a CMC perspective. Furthermore, the participant will learn about the pharmaceutical development process from a regulatory perspective. The participant will also learn about appropriate CMC review strategies for INDs and NDAs.  This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and FDA. The initial appointment is for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of FDA contingent on the availability of funds. The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. The appointment is full-time at FDA in the Silver Spring, Maryland, area. Participants do not become employees of FDA, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.  Completion of a successful background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management is required for an applicant to be on-boarded at FDA. OPM can complete a background investigation only for individuals, including non-US Citizens, who have resided in the US for a total of three of the past five years.  FDA requires ORISE participants to read and sign their FDA Education and Training Agreement within 30 days of his/her start date, setting forth the conditions and expectations for his/her educational appointment at the agency. This agreement covers such topics as the following:  Non-employee nature of the ORISE appointment;  Prohibition on ORISE Fellows performing inherently governmental functions;  Obligation of ORISE Fellows to convey all necessary rights to the FDA regarding intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice during their fellowship;  The fact that research materials and laboratory notebooks are the property of the FDA;  ORISE fellow’s obligation to protect and not to further disclose or use non-public information.

We are pushing past the limits of classical physics and current supercomputing technology to unlock a new era of computing. Quantum computing has the potential to impact every area of human society for the better. IonQ's computers will soon redefine industries like medicine, materials science, finance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptography, and more. IonQ is at the forefront of this technological revolution.   We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist. As Senior Data Scientist, you'll be part of a cross-functional team whose mission is to lead IonQ on its journey to build the world's best quantum computers to solve the world's most complex problems.  Quantum computers require precise control of the qubits to implement logic gate operations needed for computation. Imperfections in the control process, as well as the degradation of the qubits due to coupling to the environment, lead to errors in the gate operations that reduce the accuracy of long quantum computational tasks. Trapped ion qubits are of highest quality and have very long coherence times, however, errors can be introduced by control signals. The use of advanced control signals can reduce these errors and lead to higher-performing quantum computers. We are looking for a data scientist who can work closely with our engineers in collecting and analyzing data from our quantum computers, to devise better control signals that lead to higher performance gate operations.  Responsibilities:   Work with experimental and theoretical physicists, system operators and software engineers to collect and analyze data from IonQ quantum computers to develop deep understanding of the error processes in our qubits and gates  Apply stringent statistical tools, mathematical methods and novel modeling techniques to develop comprehensive and accurate error models for our gates  Devise improved control mechanisms to mitigate the dominant errors in the gates  Develop data analysis tools that embody these methods, to be used by the system to control errors during quantum computer operation  Document the error models and control methods developed in the process  Work closely with the system development team to provide insights in error and control perspective to help build better quantum computers   You'd be a good fit with:   Bachelor's degree in physics, computer science, mathematics, statistics or similar fields, or similar levels of experience - unconventional backgrounds are welcome and encouraged  Over 10 years of experience working with data from quantum systems in understanding and constructing practical error models  Over 5 years of experience in developing data analysis methods or tools relevant to quantum computers or quantum systems  Excellent verbal and written communication skills  Demonstrated ability to write effective data analysis codes to handle large datasets and extract relevant correlation information   You'd be a great fit with:   Ph.D. in Physics, Engineering, Computer Science or related fields  Experience in applying research to relevant industry problems  Demonstrated experience in working with experimental scientists or engineers to apply data analysis techniques to a practical system of interest  Familiarity with qubits, atomic systems and coherent control techniques  Experience in applying machine learning techniques for data analysis problems  Our HQ is located in College Park, Maryland and we are a 15 minute metro ride from Washington DC. We are actively building out teams in the Washington D.C., Seattle, and Boston metro areas and will want to locate you in one of these geographies. However, IonQ will be expanding into additional geographies both domestically and internationally so don't let this stop you from applying.  At IonQ, we believe in fair treatment, access, opportunity and advancement for all, while at the same time striving to identify and eliminate barriers. We empower employees to thrive by fostering a culture of autonomy, productivity, and respect.

You will help build tools for internal developers to ingest data from a wide variety of data sources and help us create usable and re-usable tools to provide value-added data for customers. Simply (is this simple?), you will help us collect, sort, maintain, enhance, debug, evolve, solve, and create data that will make a difference. And, you can do all, or at least most, of your work from anywhere (remotely!). Apply today!             What you own (responsibilities): In this role, you own and are responsible for delivering key initiatives.             Develop, enhance, and maintain data pipeline internal architecture capable of ingesting structured and unstructured data using both batch & streaming methods.      Debug and improve SQL queries, fine-tune AWS RDS Postgres instances to enhance performance.

We will expect you to come up to speed fast and deliver great work without too much guidance. We think it would be hard to do that in this job without specialized education or proven successful experience in:             Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Analytics, or another applicable field is preferred. A Master’s in Computer Science is a plus. Relevant experience may substitute for degrees.      10+ years of progressive data analysis and engineering experience desired.      5+ years of recent relevant Python, SQL, and AWS data-related experience required.      PostgreSQL experience including building and optimizing data pipelines for acquisition and management of data including data security, data capture, data cataloging, & data classification.

Success in developing automated data engineering tools.      Positive attitude with the ability to deal with ambiguity and dynamic growth environments; we are busy, growing quickly, and need team members who enjoy the challenges that come with growth including the ability to constructively prioritize and deliver on simultaneous needs.      Analytical thinking skills with integrity and discretion in handling confidential information.              What we expect from everyone: What does it take to be successful with us?

What you can expect from us:             4 weeks of paid time off every year. Most of it doesn't roll over because we know we won't use it otherwise - and we know using it makes us better at our work and to each other.      Flexible working hours and schedules (some positions-like this one-will do some on-call weekend work on occasion, but we expect you to take time off during the week to make up for it)      Casual dress      A company-paid Google Pixel phone or monthly credit to apply for your tech needs (including upgrading your bandwidth)      12 paid holidays, including Juneteenth and the day after Thanksgiving      A monthly wellness stipend that you can use for things like a meditation app, standing desk, gym equipment, etc.      401(k) matching up to 4%      Up to $5,250/year for certification, continuing education, and tuition reimbursement.

Our Corporate HQ is in Baltimore, MD, and we have our automated lines installed at customer sites in Dallas and Nashville. However, most of our employees work remotely across the U.S. and we have some in Australia and some in Europe.             The physical requirements include prolonged periods sitting at a desk and working on a computer (though you can use the tech benefit to create whatever desk you’ll work best at).             We are an agile organization, and so the duties and description of this role (like every other at Apkudo) may change at any time as we adapt.             This position is exempt based on the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
