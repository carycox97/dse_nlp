If you want to learn more about our grand vision, read what has become our ""manifesto."" Our system, developed with open source roots, shifts the paradigm of data science workflows by providing reproducibility, data provenance, and opportunity for true collaboration. Pachyderm utilizes modern technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to build an entirely new method of analyzing data. Offered both as an in-house solution as well as hosted-service, Pachyderm brings together version-control for data with the tools to build scalable end-to-end ML/AI pipelines while empowering users to use any language, framework, or tool they want.    What it's like being part of The Pach  Pachyderm is a rapidly growing, Series B company funded by the top VC's — Benchmark, Decibel, M12, and YCombinator. Pachyderm has always and will always embrace a ""Remote-first"" approach to growing our team. This allows us to hire a diverse group of individuals across the country (and world!) while giving our team members the flexibility to work from anywhere.  Being a member of The Pach means joining a supportive team that cares about you, values kindness and works hard to create an open and transparent workplace.

As an open source project, detailed GitHub issues are great, but PRs are pure gold! You'll also have direct exposure to our community of users via our open source support channels. At Pachyderm, OSS user and customer feedback is a major driver of our product roadmap and we believe that everyone within the company should experience that first-hand.
