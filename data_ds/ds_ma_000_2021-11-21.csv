Working understanding of core statistical concepts (regression, significance testing, omitted variable bias, independence/dependence, etc.).  Curiosity about creative data visualizations.  Willingness to step outside your role and independently come up with novel ideas for the business.  Willingness to challenge others' ideas and advocate for your own.  Excellent verbal and written communication skills, especially for presentations.

The NEFSC Protected Species Branch (PSB) mission includes evaluating threats to species and populations due to anthropogenic activities. The Machine Learning Programmer will be working on protected species bycatch, which is when protected animals get caught or entangled in fishing gear. Bycatch can negatively affect species such as dolphins, sea turtles, protected fish, and whales by harming animals, contributing to population declines, and impeding population recovery. For this project, video data that was collected on commercial fishing vessels as part of a fisheries monitoring program is being reviewed so that bycatch events and species can be identified and further analyzed. Since such interactions are relatively rare events, these data are sparse and an automated review of the video can be a realistic and cost effective way to identify actual or probable protected species interactions. The Machine Learning Programmer/Analyst will develop analyses of image data to inform bycatch estimates and assessments of fisheries impacts on protected species. The Analyst’s ultimate goal is to develop an algorithm automating the detection and identification of protected species visualized on video from gillnet, bottom trawl, and other types of fishing gear. The Machine Learning Programmer/Analyst will begin by curating and developing a protected species (bird, mammal, turtle) image library utilizing video and still image data sets. After that, the Machine Learning Programmer/Analyst will explore approaches to automating image analysis, developing algorithms in support of machine learning applications and annotated training data sets. Duties Gaining familiarity with the data and processes, including image review, data analysis, image data set curation, preparing and processing data.Identifying, acquiring and/or generating, and characterizing data and annotations. Investigating and determining suitable machine learning technologies and available open-source resources (software applications, coding, and curated datasets) for a data-sparse context. Training and testing models. Developing machine learning based video analysis; creating a system and workflow for conducting the automated image analysis. Generating reports that use the image data to inform assessments of fisheries impacts on protected species. Qualifications and Skills BS in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, or a closely related field. Deep proficiency in at least one programming language relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence (Python, R, Matlab, C++, VIAME, etc) Demonstrated skill and knowledge in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to image data. Experience in information extraction using machine learning, deep neural nets. Project development and management skills are desirable. Statistical programming skills are desirable. Coursework and/or exposure to biological data is desired, but not required. The skills needed are in programming, not biology. US citizenship and ability to comply with EO 14042 are required. Excellent written and oral communication skills. Track record of success in working remotely. Demonstrated ability to contribute timely deliverables and work collaboratively as part of a team. The position is expected to be full-time for one year, the rate of pay depends on skills and experience, and the position is eligible for the benefits described on the Integrated Statistics website. The position will probably start remotely but with the goal of intermittent in-person work at the NEFSC lab in Woods Hole, MA. Integrated Statistics is an equal opportunity employer and will not discriminate against any employee or applicant on the basis of age, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any classification protected by federal, state, or local law.

It is an ambitious  vision  that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of  machine   learning  and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.

The Sequence  Learning  group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other  data  sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone.

You'll work directly with Beacon Labs project teams composed of research scientists, neuroscientists and data scientists to deliver high-quality, reproducible analysis products that drive advancements in brain health, and   ...discover and formulate techniques for analysis that haven't even been attempted with EEG outside of Beacon due to lack of data and/or infrastructure (e.g. ""How might we refactor one of our deep learning-based feature detection algorithm to achieve high inter-rater agreement on noisy signals across a reduced set of channels?"", ""What data augmentation techniques or validation strategies might we try in order to assess or reduce bias in real-world environments/specific patient populations"", etc.).  ...steer engineering efforts to standardize, improve, and automate our model development/deployment lifecycle and related tooling.  ...write modular and composable code with well-defined interfaces.  ...have the opportunity to co-author scientific papers whose impact pushes the clinical, neuroscience, and machine learning communities past contemporary limitations.   About you:   You have 5+ years of relevant industrial data science experience and are well-versed in at least one DL/ML framework (e.g. Tensorflow, PyTorch, Flux).  You have extensive experience working with time series data, preferably with healthcare biosignal data (e.g. EKG, actigraphy, EEG, Polysomnography, etc.).  You're comfortable building tools and overseeing experiments that uniquely leverage data from our clinical partners, public datasets, and our own sensors to aid clinical decisions.  You realize that lowering hypothesis test turnaround time from months to minutes requires applying best-of-breed DevOps concepts to the machine learning workflow.  You've leveraged cloud infrastructure to train models on inconveniently large datasets.  You're painfully aware that thoughtful data curation is a prerequisite to analysis results that hold up under practical application.  You make use of best-of-breed experiment tracking systems to ensure that model performance is reproducible, observable, and debuggable.  You can't wait to combine your background with our unprecedented EEG dataset to blow published statistical EEG results out of the water.  You've developed a solid, heavily-exercised workflow for debugging model performance; you now know more about the limitations of automatic differentiation and distributed heterogeneous computing than you ever thought you would when you started your ML journey (e.g. ""How can I alter this model's architecture to mitigate the decrease in sample throughput once I lower the minibatch size?"").  You can ensure that we properly select and rigorously measure the quantities we're optimizing for, both in our research and in our business.  You enjoy working in teams and providing/receiving regular feedback to improve technical and operational practices.  You have excellent speaking, listening and writing skills.  You're excited to work in an environment that makes heavy use of Julia, Docker/K8s, workflow orchestration tools (e.g. Argo, Airflow), SQL, and GraphQL.   Not sure if you meet 100% of our qualifications?

We’re a growing pharmaceutical company that is breaking through in neurology and oncology, with a strong emphasis on research and development. Our history includes the development of many innovative medicines, notably the discovery of the world's most widely-used treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. As we continue to expand, we are seeking highly-motivated individuals who want to work in a fast-paced environment and make a difference. If this is your profile, we want to hear from you. General Summary: Eisai has been dedicated for decades to the pursuit of novel therapeutics to improve the lives of people suffering from dementia and their families. Recognizing the potential for human genetics, data sciences and precision chemistry to disrupt the drug discovery paradigm, Eisai launched the Eisai Center for Genetics Guided Dementia Discovery (G2D2) in 2019 to accelerate the discovery of innovative therapeutics. G2D2 is a unique drug discovery organization driven by a diverse group of passionate, dedicated and collaborative scientists committed to one goal: delivering breakthroughs for patients and their families. All Eisai employees, as part of the company’s human health care (hhc) mission, spend at least 1% of their working time with patients and families to ensure that the innovation we drive is based on an understanding of their real needs. The predominant research focus at G2D2, driven by insights from human genetics, is immunodementia: targeting immune-related targets for dementia. At G2D2, we focus not only on how human genetics and other human biology data may identify and validate therapeutic targets with increased likelihood of success in clinical trials, but also how this data guides selection of the best approaches to design new therapeutics and the selection of strategies to deliver these therapeutics to the right patient at the right time. Recognizing the obvious alignment between human genetics and nucleic acid modalities, our precision chemistry strategy is to directly validate human biology hypotheses by utilizing our unique RNA targeting therapeutic platform. G2D2’s expertise in harnessing molecular complexity (stereochemistry and topology) to successfully discover and develop natural product based therapeutics has been applied to create an evolving unique nucleic acid immunotherapeutic platform that is being employed globally in multiple clinical and pre-clinical programs at Eisai. G2D2’s cutting-edge 50,000-square-foot facility is strategically located in Cambridge, MA, to accelerate collaborations with leading research institutes in this world-class biotech hub. Our facility has been designed around an open-lab concept, enabling scientists with multi-disciplinary backgrounds to work together in a single integrated lab space. Our labs include state-of-the-art capabilities that support the variety of disciplines located at the site, including medicinal and process chemistry, in-vitro and in-vivo biology, microscopy, DMPK, drug safety, chemical and structural biology, automation and screening, and more. G2D2 is home to Eisai’s global capabilities in neurology discovery data science. G2D2 is also home to other global Eisai functions, including global health, DMPK, Safety, IP, oncology, thus providing a rich environment for cross-functional interaction. Our office is designed to foster an atmosphere of mission-driven and collaborative science, using new collaboration tools and technologies, and is being optimized to support a hybrid work environment. At Eisai, we highly value both internal and external collaboration and pursue flexible research models with a range of external scientific partners to accelerate delivery of innovative medicines. To this end, the G2D2 facility includes the Eisai Innovation Center Biolabs, which provides space and infrastructure to start-up/spin-out companies conducting high-risk but potentially transformative research that can impact the discovery of breakthrough neuroscience therapeutics. More information about G2D2 is provided here: ( http://eisai.mediaroom.com/2018-06-12-Eisai-Inc-to-Launch-Center-for-Genetics-Guided-Dementia-Discovery-in-Cambridge-Massachusetts ) and here ( https://us.eisai.com/research/g2d2 ), and about Eisai's Neurology strategy and pipeline are provided here ( https://www.eisai.com/index.html ). The candidate will be responsible for leveraging computational methods to advance drug discovery from target identification through clinical strategy design. While the focus will be on utilizing predictive modelling to support neurology-related translational science, the candidate will also be providing general bioinformatics expertise to help directly guide therapeutic research across a variety of programs and platforms.
