The technological advances and broad applications of data and information sciences have had a profound impact on almost every aspect of human culture, including the arts. While aesthetic decisions are central to translating data, data has also become a rich source material for artistic creation, inspiration, and interrogation. Data algorithms and artificial intelligence offer potential solutions to some of the world’s most complex and intractable problems, yet the rise of this ‘datafication’ comes with its own perils. Increasingly, the same tools that promise liberatory innovations, democratic access, connectivity, and economic growth are the ones that may serve to exclude, marginalize, and reiterate structural inequities and asymmetric power relations. GAHDT and TDAI invite applications for a two-year post-MFA/postdoctoral fellowship in arts and data with the aim of seeding research and creative expressions that grapple with both the challenges and opportunities of big data, with an emphasis on social justice interventions. We are particularly interested in artists and/or scholars whose work engages big data (from databases, simulations, computations, statistics, search engines, etc.) and its social and political implications. This work may take the form of (but is not limited to) scholarly output, exhibitions, installations, digital art, data art, AI art, etc. We seek an emerging artist and/or scholar who will: 1) develop and contribute to cross-disciplinary research or creative work and teaching in arts and data; 2) offer innovative and collaborative undergraduate and/or graduate courses; 3) be an active member of both GAHDT and TDAI. About this Opportunity: A. The post-MFA/postdoctoral researcher is expected to be in full- time residence during the academic year beginning August 2022. In alignment with university guidelines and best practices, preference will be given to applicants who have received a PhD, MFA, or other terminal degree no more than three years prior to the beginning of their appointment and to those with interdisciplinary backgrounds. B. In addition to working on their own research or creative projects in Arts and Data, the post-MFA/postdoctoral researcher is expected to teach one class a year and to collaborate with TDAI and GAHDT on related program initiatives. C. The compensation package includes a salary of $55,000 plus fringe benefits and $2,000 in research support. D. The department appointment will depend on the candidate's areas of teaching expertise and alignment with Department needs. This is a two-year position. To Apply: A. Please submit electronic copies of a cover letter that addresses why you are interested in the position, a research statement and writing sample or artist statement and portfolio no later than March 1, 2022.

Continuing to specialize in easy-to-use software for robots and automation, READY is proud to help all manufacturers solve their labor challenges, boost output, improve quality, reduce costs, and augment their workforce through automation.  Summary  Robots are complex devices, and finding users with the expertise to program them is a tall order. Additionally, the best robot programs come from users that are highly experienced in both programming robots, and who are highly knowledgeable about the industrial task the robot will perform. This expertise is captured in many places, but exists chiefly in existing workers who previously performed the automated task (for domain knowledge), or in expert-created robot programs for similarly automated tasks (for automation knowledge). Our goal is to provide assistance to an end user who is programming a robot, by using machine learning to analyze these two sources of knowledge and build a generalizable model of several industrial tasks. This task model can then be leveraged for relevant tasks to provide additional information and guidance while a user creates the automation program.  We are looking for a seasoned data scientist to explore this application of machine learning, specifically by building machine learning algorithms that can extract structure from previously written robot programs, as well as from annotated video recordings of manufacturing personnel explaining the task to be automated. We expect that with a corpus of automation best-practices derived from the expert programs, and process best-practices from the annotated oral instructions, it will be possible to create a model of not only how those tasks are performed, but the steps to automate them.  This position reports to READY's Chief Innovation Officer and can be fully remote, with occasional travel to Columbus, OH headquarters and customer sites.  This is a 12 month assignment with full time employee benefits, including health insurance, paid time off, and 401(k) matching.  Essential Duties   Analyze a dataset of annotated video transcriptions describing industrial tasks into the key steps of those tasks  Analyze a dataset of annotated robot and automation programs that task a robot with performing a similar task  Build a machine learning pipeline for creating a task model representing the tasks performed in the data  Build a query system where based on a given set of task constraints, the task model can be queried to provide relevant information, guidance or assistance for the end-user  Work with a world-class team of robotics researchers and engineers  Work iteratively in a fast paced environment   Skills   Fluent in Python  3+ years of machine learning and/or AI experience  Hands-on experience on large scale machine learning systems  Strong fundamentals in mathematics  Experience with PyTorch, Tensorflow or other machine learning frameworks   Ideal Candidate Attributes   PhD in Robotics, Data Science or Computer Science, or MS + 5 years of industry experience  Experience with Deep Neural Networks, and other Machine Learning techniques, with specific application to robotics or manufacturing  Experience in ontologies and/or relational databases as they pertain to robotics  Familiarity with Ontology management tools such as Protégé",7 days ago,
