It consists of five departments: Biomedical Engineering (joint with the UAB School of Medicine), Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering with approximately 50 faculty members and enrolls about 900 undergraduate and 500 graduate students. The School of Engineering includes six undergraduate majors in five academic departments, as well as more than 15 graduate degree programs. UAB Engineering offers highly adaptable programs that range from traditional M.S./Ph.D. pathways to online master of engineering degree tracks for working professionals. UAB Engineering offers unique opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration—not only within engineering but with other academic departments across campus and local industry.                          Neuroengineering and Neuroscience at           UAB                          The Schools of Engineering and Medicine are located on the same physical campus in the heart of Birmingham, just a few minutes’ walk apart. Engineering and Medicine recently launched a joint Ph.D. program in Neuroengineering, and engineering undergraduates have the opportunity to pursue a minor in neuroengineering. Research in neuroengineering is supported by collaboration with the Departments of Neurology, Neurobiology, and Neurosurgery in the School of Medicine and with the Comprehensive Neuroscience Center, which has more than 350 members. Neuroscience research at UAB is currently supported by more than $128M in active grants. The centerpiece of the UAB Health System is the 1150-bed University Hospital, among the largest in the United States. The health care facility spans 5 city blocks, occupies 13 major buildings, and covers 2.1 million square feet of space. Clinical neuroscience areas of strength include stroke and vascular disease, movement disorders, memory disorders, epilepsy, neuroimmunology, neuroimaging, neuromuscular disease and neuro-oncology. There are active programs in deep brain stimulation and epilepsy surgery; the functional neurosurgery group performs 250 awake craniotomies per year, providing excellent opportunities for in vivo human recording. There are also active programs in functional and molecular neuroimaging. Key NIH Center and infrastructure awards include a Morris K. Udall Center of Excellence in Parkinson’s Research, an NIA funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and an NIH Brain Initiative UH3 award. UAB is a site for both NeuroNEXT, the NIH network for phase II trials, and StrokeNet, which supports NIH clinical trials in stroke.

The land surface acts as a link between the solid earth and atmosphere; thus, characterizing land surface features and related biogeochemical processes gain significance to address land-atmospheric interactions and climate variations. With recent advances in remote sensing technologies, various satellites with spectral and temporal characteristics are readily available for research and operational decisions. In particular, NASA has a fleet of Earth observation satellite missions currently operating (Landsat-7,8,9, ECOSTRESS, TERRA, CALIPSO, GEDI, GPM, GRACE-FO, Suomi NPP, etc.,) as well as future planned missions (Landsat-9, NISAR, GeoCarb, Sentinel-6/Jason-CS, SWOT, etc.) useful to map and monitor land surface characteristics and processes. In addition, the commercial Very High Resolution Data such as Planetscope and MAXAR data available free of charge to NASA researchers may be integrated into the analysis. This NASA Postdoctoral Program opportunity supports scientific investigations that aim to document the use of the latest remote sensing datasets for land surface characterization and process-related studies. We welcome proposals on the following topics:  Mapping and monitoring land cover changes in diverse regions of the world, integrating novel remote sensing methods such as machine learning, deep learning, data fusion, and dense time-series analysis.  Quantifying the impacts of land use/cover changes such as urban expansion, agricultural land loss, land abandonment, deforestation, logging, and reforestation on the environment using multi-satellite datasets (hyperspectral, multispectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) including light detection and ranging (LiDAR)).  Use of thermal remote sensing data to characterize urban environments, heat island effects, and impacts.  Use of remote sensing data to address public health problems such as disease vector habitat characterization and epidemiology, distributions, life cycles, and host interactions.  Land surface and hydrological modeling to develop offline modeling systems to accelerate the use of NASA datasets in operational research.  Integrating observations from current (e.g., S-NPP, GOES-16, SMAP, GPM, GRACE, Landsat-7) and near-future (SWOT, Landsat-9, NISAR) NASA satellites to demonstrate forecast improvements to land surface models (e.g., Noah-MP, ALEXI) and hydrologic models (e.g., CREST, WRF-Hydro) in support of the transition to operations activities at the Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center at Marshall Space Flight Center.   The prospective applicant should contact Dr. Krishna Vadrevu (krishna.p.vadrevu@nasa.gov) well in advance of developing the proposal to ensure alignment of the idea with opportunity objectives. Please include a Curriculum Vitae (CV) and a brief statement of interest that identifies the primary topic of interest from those listed above. Other related topics will also be considered.
