For more details, read on!  About the Company:  We all waste a staggering amount of time (~33%) because we have no idea where we are spending it. Worse yet, we continue to operate in a factory model that simply does not apply to creative work. Our big bet is that by understanding time, we'll be able to move away from it as a unit of value. In the future knowledge economy (lawyers, accountants, engineers), contributions will be assessed on value added, not the underlying time spent adding it.  Ambitious mission to say the least, so where are we starting? We have created a new market category called  Time Automation  that automates the timekeeping process for professionals and allows us to collect time data at scale. Before TBP, professionals had to manually record every six minutes of their day into antiquated timekeeping software. Not anymore.  We are a Series B company (>$55M in venture capital from Tier 1 funds) that has assembled some of the best builders, designers, and product minds in tech—and we all have one thing in common: we are deeply motivated by our mission  to return time .  We need to find like-minded colleagues who want to join us on our journey and are willing to spend their time solving time. It will be a long road but if we're even half right, we'll change the way work is measured and performed forever.  About the Role:  Come lead our Product Automation Strategy and use of ML to return human time as our Director of Engineering for Machine Learning. This role is responsible for creating a system that fundamentally understands how people work, then applying this the problem we are solving today of shortening the time users spend converting work activities into timesheets to deliver on our promise to help timekeepers bill more time,  in   less time.  While we build out our burgeoning ML group, this role requires you to develop short and mid term strategy, recruiting of a world class engineering team, and relentless product execution by bringing real-world use of machine learning and coupling it in a consumer-grade software experience for enterprise customers.  As the first leadership hire dedicated to this core company function, you will set the culture and approach — boldly differentiating us from our competition and stirring the imagination of the many customers we serve and will serve tomorrow on the possibilities of Time Automation for their industries (yes, beyond legal).  You will be responsible for a full stack team that will include the data storage and processing infrastructure, the cleansing and analysis of the data, model creation and delivery, integration of those models into backend services and the presentation layer, and regular feedback telemetry monitoring for in-field performance. You will be broadly empowered to make both the technology selections and engineering process decisions to optimally deliver.  Core Duties:  Build, own, and drive our Automation strategy and technology, and in particular our Machine Learning and other Predictive Services work to help minimize time and effort for timesheet creation.  Collaborate with the Design team to create a design language that helps our users understand how TBP works for them, demystifying the automation.  Lead our Engineering efforts to develop a world class infrastructure and pipeline for data, machine learning, and model management that allows us to improve the product at blistering speed (model creation, management, and deployment).  Deliver regular releases of models and service releases to improve the products automation capabilities.  Collaborate with Sales, Product Marketing, and Customer Success so they effectively speak to our automation capabilities for their stakeholders, driving product sales and adoption.  Maintain a strong understanding of customer behavior, the competitive landscape, and industry trends and meet with our stakeholders regularly.  Develop our forward strategy with data and new products we can create and sell.

If you're close to our SF or LA offices, we'd love to have you into the office at least once a week once it's safe (targeting 2022).  Compensation:  Competitive salary, generous equity, comprehensive medical/dental/vision coverage with covered premiums, 401(k), additional benefits including wellness/commuter/FSA stipends.

At the same time, there is a growing awareness of the significant safety, ethical, and societal challenges stemming from misuse and unintended consequences of AI systems. Risks related to artificial intelligence take many forms including privacy, security, safety, fairness, equity, explainability, polarization, disinformation, and the distribution of power. How we understand and manage these risks throughout the AI lifecycle will determine whether the full upside potential of these technologies can be realized and whether we can prevent significant and disproportionate harms. The Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) is seeking a creative and driven postdoctoral researcher for an Independent Postdoctoral Fellowship in Responsible AI. This researcher should bring a strong background in ethical and responsible practice in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in performing data-intensive research. The position requires the Fellow to create a research project that answers questions related to the ethical and responsible use and development of AI systems and machine learning technologies. Research topics might include (but are not limited to) automation and job displacement, algorithmic bias, explainable AI, and other concerns of inequality and distributive justice globally. We are especially interested in developing methods for evaluating AI systems with respect to emerging standards in government regulations about privacy, bias, fairness, and explainability. Ideally the work will have the potential to affect policy. The Data Science and Responsible AI Postdoctoral Fellowship is a full-time two-year position at BIDS. It is made possible by funding from Accenture Applied Intelligence. The Fellowship holder will be expected to produce novel research results communicated in academic publications and to lead a workshop or seminar series on the topic of the research; other possible contributions include open-source scientific software, curated datasets, and white papers and blog articles on data science and responsible AI. In defining and carrying out the independent, self-directed research project, the Fellow will work under the guidance and mentorship of an advisory team made up of BIDS Faculty Affiliates and research staff including Professor Rediet Abebe and Professor Stuart Russell (Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences), Professor Tolani Britton (Graduate School of Education) and Dr. Jessica Newman (AI Security Initiative). The position will also benefit from collaboration with Accenture Applied Intelligence. Accenture supports BIDS' research and educational objectives in data science with current foci on environment and energy, ethical AI, and social justice. The Fellow will be able to leverage this relationship to fully harness the data landscape and expertise available. In addition, as part of the BIDS research community, the Fellow will have the opportunity to learn from individuals engaged in research software development, computational reproducibility, and data-intensive research from a wide range of application domains. Responsibilities Define and perform independent research to increase the understanding of ethical, political, and societal concerns embedded in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies Identify research-based solutions to improve theory and practice in ethical and responsible AI Help to establish transparent and open best practices useful for performing data-intensive research in responsible/ethical AI, as well as in general use. Develop a workshop or seminar series for BIDS faculty, researchers, and collaborators and the larger UC Berkeley responsible AI community. Give talks and presentations to a variety of audiences including the University of California community, Accenture Applied Intelligence leaders and researchers, and globally at relevant conferences.

Job summary AWS has the most services and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider–from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases–to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things. AWS Platform is the glue that holds the AWS ecosystem together. Whether its Identity features such as access management and sign on, cryptography, console, builder & developer tools, and even projects like automating all of our contractual billing systems, AWS Platform is always innovating with the customer in mind. The AWS Platform team sustains over 750 million transactions per second. AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) is AWS’s workforce identity solution. Our internal mantra is “Identities should be able to come from anywhere and customers should be able to use those identities to gain access to anything”. We provide customers with the ability to associate a directory with AWS or use our Native User Pool, then the customer can assign access to their AWS Accounts and 3rd Party Business Applications in a central place. In addition, end-users of AWS SSO have a central place where they can view and access all of the things they have been assigned access to with our AWS SSO User Portal. Our team owns the services and data which enables AWS SSO to federate users into their “things” and our public catalog supports hundreds of integrations and we are actively expanding the types of integrations which we support.

We also work on new public standards like FastFed. Our team is customer focused and we understand the need for learning new things to meet our customer’s needs. We actively seek and evaluate learning opportunities and we are always supportive of each other as we all grow. We have a range of talent in the team.

There is a pager rotation for the team, however we do our best to limit the number of customer impacting events. When we do impact our customers we dive into how we can make this never happen again and we take action to fix it. The team usually gets paged once or twice per week for various reasons. If you’re up until 2am dealing with a customer impacting event then the team will look to help you get sleep by covering your oncall. The team values diversity. We are happy to have members representing 6 different countries! Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship.
