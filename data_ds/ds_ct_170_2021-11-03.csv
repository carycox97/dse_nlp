If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.  Our Client Our client is rethinking the way that code is written. Today, most people write code by sitting at a desk, memorizing a syntax that varies with different tools, and pushing buttons. And, doing so for long periods of time is known to cause physical pain. We'd know—our client created the company after developing repetitive strain injuries (think carpal tunnel), common among people who use computers all day, that made typing incredibly painful. We're building a future where everyone can write code with the highest-bandwidth input mechanism we have: our voice.  Our mission: make programming more efficient and accessible to everyone.  Our client would require you to be able to be at the office in San Francisco, CA.   The Role & Responsibilities   We're looking for machine learning engineers excited to apply the latest in ASR and NLP to code and build on our speech-to-code platform.
