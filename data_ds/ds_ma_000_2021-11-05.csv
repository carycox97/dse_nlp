Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in America. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians (Groups), technologists (Athena, Hudson River Trading) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to America's future health. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz and AlleyCorp.  We are launching Pearl Health to help PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. Over time, this solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients, increasing their autonomy, creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence, and making risk more available and more readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is launching a new value-based care program to disrupt Traditional Medicare, and we believe that this represents an opportunity to achieve the meaningful change we envision.  What we hope you can do...  We are seeking a brilliant Data Scientist with a track record of propeling business strategies through analytical insights and algorithmic systems. Your work will be a core asset of our company, allowing us to more efficiently provide better care to our members and to create novel financial arrangements for each of our aligned physicians. You should be a strategic and analytical thinker, an effective communicator, an expert in analytical and data infrastructure systems, comfortable working with actuaries on complicated risk analyses, and performing sophisticated modeling exercises independently.

Translate the company's goals and vision into its strategy and operations by conducting sophisticated quantitative analyses while informing decisions about our infrastructure and approach  Help us change the future of work for doctors in America by applying state of the art technology solutions, including machine learning, natural language processing, and explicable AI - likely in partnership with key external partners.  Support all business lines, including sales and business development, by enabling those teams to nimbly make data-driven decisions, balancing competing goals, and making difficult trade-offs when required.  Partner effectively with our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer toward best-in-class analytics systems to give our physician partners insight into their patient panels.  Support the technology needs of various departments by creating a data-literate ecosystem.  Who you are…  3-5 years of experience in performing results-driven quantitative analysis in a collaborative environment.  Degree in statistics, applied math, computer science, engineering or a related field.  SQL expertise and strong foundation in at least one of the main data science programming languages. Python is our current primary language and is preferred.  Experience manipulating messy and inconsistent data sets, performing statistical analyses, and presenting insights in an easily-accessible and timely fashion.  A proven ability to conduct research and empower data-driven aspects of our product through a mix of internal resources and external vendors, especially in AI, ML and NLP domains.  Experience collaborating with data engineering teams to define needs for an ETL pipeline and familiarity with the most common ETL tools.  Thoughtful collaborator, able to manage multiple demanding stakeholders, assimilate complex information quickly, and scope work in a way that balances deep insight and fast turnaround.  Prior experience working with healthcare data in any part of the industry (payor, provider, pharmacy, etc.); familiarity with population health data is preferred but not essential  The First 90 Days….  We aren't the over-prescriptive types but to give you a sense of what we think we'll do in your first 3 months together:  First 30 Days:  Get your hands dirty really understanding the universe of doctors we will be partnering with in our first year in the Direct Contracting model. Help us profile risk, identify opportunities for performance improvement, and lay the foundation for the work we will do in the year ahead.

First 60 Days:  Navigate the crucial launch window for the 2022 Performance Year where we will receive our first batch of data from our DCE partners and begin providing our service to our doctors. Become a subject matter expert on our datasets and define the measures we will use to guide our work throughout the performance year.  First 90 Days:  Own the ongoing performance analysis and improvement process as we do both bespoke work with our practices and productize insights into the platform. Dig deep on the opportunities for growth within our existing universe of doctors and potential acquisitions for Performance Year 2.  Our Values  We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and our employees are people with different strengths, experiences and backgrounds, who share a passion for improving people's lives.

Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission. About the Team:  The Data Team is highly empowered at Quora, helping navigate complexity and influencing product and company strategy directly.
