https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=11f75fb0160f656a&from=web&vjs=3,100,Managing Director: Yale University Data-Intensive Social Science Center,OpenTeams,"New Haven, CT","Managing Director - Yale University Data-Intensive Social Science Center (Yale University, New Haven Connecticut)  Introduction  Yale has long been a leader in social science, educating students and conducting research relevant to the most pressing issues facing the world today. Excellent social science takes place across the campus: in departments in the Faculty of Arts of Sciences, the Law School, the School of Management, the School of the Environment (formerly Forestry & Environmental Studies), the School of Public Health, and elsewhere.  Recently, Yale has been focused on two key priorities in the social sciences. The first has been to transform the Jackson Institute into the Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs, Yale's first new school in over four decades. The second has been to apply empirical social science to public policy questions, an area that spans schools and departments and complements Yale's many existing strengths. As President Salovey wrote, “[a] great university should be engaging in the great debates of its era, and our students – the leaders of tomorrow – should participate. But that engagement must be grounded in evidence-based inquiry and rigorous analysis of facts.” To this end, in 2019, the Tobin Center for Economic Policy was launched to advance rigorous, nonpartisan economic research that defines and informs domestic policy debates.  In order to investigate and guide additional investments in this priority area, in 2020, former provost Ben Polak convened the University-wide Committee on Data-Intensive Social Sciences. The committee solicited feedback from faculty members in relevant areas and schools. Committee members studied peer institutions to learn how they support research and education in data-intensive social science. They reviewed Yale's current offerings and resources, as well as challenges and areas that could be strengthened. As a result of these efforts, the committee recommended the creation of a new Center for Data-Intensive Social Science (DISSC) with the mission to provide a world class, user-centered infrastructure supporting the acquisition, security, and use of the new data resources that are transforming social science research. This recommendation was adopted by the University and Yale's leadership is now moving forward aggressively to find a leader to help launch this important new effort.  Position Description  Reporting to DISSC faculty directors and the Vice Provost for Research, the Managing Director will be responsible for overseeing operations and services of the DISSC. The Managing Director will lead two core objectives: stand up and run a new research support core facility and advance alignment of complex systems to support data-intensive research.  The Managing Director will (1) Establish and oversee construction and operation of a new core facility focused on meeting customer/researcher needs as well as the needs of data-owning partners. They will lead and oversee efforts to: Build and maintain infrastructure including design, develop, maintain and continuously improve the underlying infrastructure necessary to facilitate data intensive social science research; Support individual researchers and research initiatives providing direct technical and legal expertise as well as research support for researchers seeking to conduct data-intensive research, including data acquisition, management, security, access and analytic support; and improve access to external data sources and partnership seeking out data and research partners beyond Yale to form research and other collaborations.  (2) Advance university-wide efficiency, effectiveness and risk mitigation across the landscape of policies, data assets and functional components that interface with and support data intensive social science research. They will identify opportunities, make recommendations, help reach consensus, and support system transformation to optimize institutional processes to improve access and security; pool and share data assets already at Yale; and assemble, support and align the components that support data intensive research.  They will work with faculty directors and advisors to identify future opportunities to promote data-intensive social science research to build community and connections around data-intensive methods across the University's departments and schools. The Managing Director will help unlock great potential for impact and play an essential role in generating new insights that can improve the world.  They will develop and implement strategic plans, establish goals and timelines; make recommendations on university policy; design, run and direct services and implementation of policy changes; assess center needs for talent, develop position descriptions, hire, and manage technical professionals and consultants; and develop collaborative partnership with internal and external entities.  They will coordinate the Faculty Advisory Board building community for researchers across the University with expertise and interests in the different methods and applications of data-intensive social science.
