We’re a growing pharmaceutical company that is breaking through in neurology and oncology, with a strong emphasis on research and development. Our history includes the development of many innovative medicines, notably the discovery of the world's most widely-used treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. As we continue to expand, we are seeking highly-motivated individuals who want to work in a fast-paced environment and make a difference. If this is your profile, we want to hear from you. General Summary: Eisai has been dedicated for decades to the pursuit of novel therapeutics to improve the lives of people suffering from dementia and their families. Recognizing the potential for human genetics, data sciences and precision chemistry to disrupt the drug discovery paradigm, Eisai launched the Eisai Center for Genetics Guided Dementia Discovery (G2D2) in 2019 to accelerate the discovery of innovative therapeutics. G2D2 is a unique drug discovery organization driven by a diverse group of passionate, dedicated and collaborative scientists committed to one goal: delivering breakthroughs for patients and their families. All Eisai employees, as part of the company’s human health care (hhc) mission, spend at least 1% of their working time with patients and families to ensure that the innovation we drive is based on an understanding of their real needs. The predominant research focus at G2D2, driven by insights from human genetics, is immunodementia: targeting immune-related targets for dementia. At G2D2, we focus not only on how human genetics and other human biology data may identify and validate therapeutic targets with increased likelihood of success in clinical trials, but also how this data guides selection of the best approaches to design new therapeutics and the selection of strategies to deliver these therapeutics to the right patient at the right time. Recognizing the obvious alignment between human genetics and nucleic acid modalities, our precision chemistry strategy is to directly validate human biology hypotheses by utilizing our unique RNA targeting therapeutic platform. G2D2’s expertise in harnessing molecular complexity (stereochemistry and topology) to successfully discover and develop natural product based therapeutics has been applied to create an evolving unique nucleic acid immunotherapeutic platform that is being employed globally in multiple clinical and pre-clinical programs at Eisai. G2D2’s cutting-edge 50,000-square-foot facility is strategically located in Cambridge, MA, to accelerate collaborations with leading research institutes in this world-class biotech hub. Our facility has been designed around an open-lab concept, enabling scientists with multi-disciplinary backgrounds to work together in a single integrated lab space. Our labs include state-of-the-art capabilities that support the variety of disciplines located at the site, including medicinal and process chemistry, in-vitro and in-vivo biology, microscopy, DMPK, drug safety, chemical and structural biology, automation and screening, and more. G2D2 is home to Eisai’s global capabilities in neurology discovery data science. G2D2 is also home to other global Eisai functions, including global health, DMPK, Safety, IP, oncology, thus providing a rich environment for cross-functional interaction. Our office is designed to foster an atmosphere of mission-driven and collaborative science, using new collaboration tools and technologies, and is being optimized to support a hybrid work environment. At Eisai, we highly value both internal and external collaboration and pursue flexible research models with a range of external scientific partners to accelerate delivery of innovative medicines. To this end, the G2D2 facility includes the Eisai Innovation Center Biolabs, which provides space and infrastructure to start-up/spin-out companies conducting high-risk but potentially transformative research that can impact the discovery of breakthrough neuroscience therapeutics.

You'll work directly with Beacon Labs project teams composed of research scientists, neuroscientists and data scientists to deliver high-quality, reproducible analysis products that drive advancements in brain health, and   ...discover and formulate techniques for analysis that haven't even been attempted with EEG outside of Beacon due to lack of data and/or infrastructure (e.g. ""How might we refactor one of our deep learning-based feature detection algorithm to achieve high inter-rater agreement on noisy signals across a reduced set of channels?"", ""What data augmentation techniques or validation strategies might we try in order to assess or reduce bias in real-world environments/specific patient populations"", etc.).  ...steer engineering efforts to standardize, improve, and automate our model development/deployment lifecycle and related tooling.  ...write modular and composable code with well-defined interfaces.  ...have the opportunity to co-author scientific papers whose impact pushes the clinical, neuroscience, and machine learning communities past contemporary limitations.   About you:   You have 5+ years of relevant industrial data science experience and are well-versed in at least one DL/ML framework (e.g. Tensorflow, PyTorch, Flux).  You have extensive experience working with time series data, preferably with healthcare biosignal data (e.g. EKG, actigraphy, EEG, Polysomnography, etc.).  You're comfortable building tools and overseeing experiments that uniquely leverage data from our clinical partners, public datasets, and our own sensors to aid clinical decisions.

You make use of best-of-breed experiment tracking systems to ensure that model performance is reproducible, observable, and debuggable.
