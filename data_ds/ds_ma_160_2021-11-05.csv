Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.   From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the team  At Roku, the Data Science team lives and works on a kind of frontier: We get called in for things that haven't been done before. This requires meaningful collaboration with the platform team, the firmware team and even the finance team to prove or disprove new product ideas. Often the idea evolves from what was first proposed until it is a wholly new thing that gets shipped. No one here is ashamed to present their latest work, and you'll find yourself pitching ideas to others in the company, including to executives.   Beyond collaboration, we seek builders with the persistence to keep pushing. Because we spend our time making prototypes and testing brand new ideas on systems with a lot of moving parts, we are faced with failures every day. The only way to really make something work is to really dig into the reasons and understand why. We value the grit and persistence it takes to keep just trying.  About the role  Roku pioneered TV streaming and continues to innovate and lead the industry. The Roku Channel has us well-positioned to help shape the future of streaming. Continued success relies on investing in Data Science and diving deep into the economics of our business.   This role is right for you if you enjoy diving into messy data, cleaning it up, finding powerful insights, presenting them in a compelling way, developing models and then working closely with software engineers to automate this process, to prove it out at scale. You should also relish the ability to influence the direction of the team's strategic goals, question the inherent assumptions in our thinking, and defining the business objectives in an innovative and encouraging environment.   The ideal candidate will have endless curiosity and can pair a global mindset with locally relevant execution. You should be a gritty problem solver and self-starter who can drive programs with the product and commercial teams within Roku and across external strategic partner organizations. The successful candidate will display a balance of hard and soft skills, including the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.  What you'll be doing  Develop data science algorithms to improve user experience on Roku's platform.  Develop economic models (e.g., market design, pricing, program evaluation, and forecasting) to better understand the user experience on Roku's platform.  Run live experiments to prototype the improvements and prove their efficacy.  Dive into data, clean it up, and pull-out insights that can be used to improve system performance and present to senior leaders with recommendations on business actions.  Assist the development team with productization of successful algorithms, ensuring your work continues to drive value at scale.  Provide expert consultative assistance to other teams in the company, including data scientists working in other areas of Roku's stack and provide technical feedback on their econometric work.  Contribute to the technical vision of the Data Science team.  We're excited if you have  PhD Degree  6 yrs + of experience post PhD in Machine Learning, Operations Research, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, or similar quantitative field.  Experience in causal Machine Learning and experimentation.  Proven problem solving and analytical abilities.  Software development skills in Python, Java, Julia or Scala.  Proficiency with analysis tools such as Spark, R, MATLAB or similar.  Experience with TB or PB size datasets preferred.  Nice-to-have's include knowledge of user behavior in subscription and advertising-based video, auctions and/or advertising.  The Roku culture  Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.   We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

With this emphasis on data and empirics, we aim to balance rigor and pragmatism, searching for scrappy solutions in pursuit of our mission.

We’re a growing pharmaceutical company that is breaking through in neurology and oncology, with a strong emphasis on research and development. Our history includes the development of many innovative medicines, notably the discovery of the world's most widely-used treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. As we continue to expand, we are seeking highly-motivated individuals who want to work in a fast-paced environment and make a difference. If this is your profile, we want to hear from you. General Summary: Eisai has been dedicated for decades to the pursuit of novel therapeutics to improve the lives of people suffering from dementia and their families. Recognizing the potential for human genetics, data sciences and precision chemistry to disrupt the drug discovery paradigm, Eisai launched the Eisai Center for Genetics Guided Dementia Discovery (G2D2) in 2019 to accelerate the discovery of innovative therapeutics. G2D2 is a unique drug discovery organization driven by a diverse group of passionate, dedicated and collaborative scientists committed to one goal: delivering breakthroughs for patients and their families. All Eisai employees, as part of the company’s human health care (hhc) mission, spend at least 1% of their working time with patients and families to ensure that the innovation we drive is based on an understanding of their real needs. The predominant research focus at G2D2, driven by insights from human genetics, is immunodementia: targeting immune-related targets for dementia. At G2D2, we focus not only on how human genetics and other human biology data may identify and validate therapeutic targets with increased likelihood of success in clinical trials, but also how this data guides selection of the best approaches to design new therapeutics and the selection of strategies to deliver these therapeutics to the right patient at the right time. Recognizing the obvious alignment between human genetics and nucleic acid modalities, our precision chemistry strategy is to directly validate human biology hypotheses by utilizing our unique RNA targeting therapeutic platform. G2D2’s expertise in harnessing molecular complexity (stereochemistry and topology) to successfully discover and develop natural product based therapeutics has been applied to create an evolving unique nucleic acid immunotherapeutic platform that is being employed globally in multiple clinical and pre-clinical programs at Eisai. G2D2’s cutting-edge 50,000-square-foot facility is strategically located in Cambridge, MA, to accelerate collaborations with leading research institutes in this world-class biotech hub. Our facility has been designed around an open-lab concept, enabling scientists with multi-disciplinary backgrounds to work together in a single integrated lab space. Our labs include state-of-the-art capabilities that support the variety of disciplines located at the site, including medicinal and process chemistry, in-vitro and in-vivo biology, microscopy, DMPK, drug safety, chemical and structural biology, automation and screening, and more. G2D2 is home to Eisai’s global capabilities in neurology discovery data science. G2D2 is also home to other global Eisai functions, including global health, DMPK, Safety, IP, oncology, thus providing a rich environment for cross-functional interaction. Our office is designed to foster an atmosphere of mission-driven and collaborative science, using new collaboration tools and technologies, and is being optimized to support a hybrid work environment. At Eisai, we highly value both internal and external collaboration and pursue flexible research models with a range of external scientific partners to accelerate delivery of innovative medicines. To this end, the G2D2 facility includes the Eisai Innovation Center Biolabs, which provides space and infrastructure to start-up/spin-out companies conducting high-risk but potentially transformative research that can impact the discovery of breakthrough neuroscience therapeutics. More information about G2D2 is provided here: ( http://eisai.mediaroom.com/2018-06-12-Eisai-Inc-to-Launch-Center-for-Genetics-Guided-Dementia-Discovery-in-Cambridge-Massachusetts ) and here ( https://us.eisai.com/research/g2d2 ), and about Eisai's Neurology strategy and pipeline are provided here ( https://www.eisai.com/index.html ). The candidate will be responsible for leveraging computational methods to advance drug discovery from target identification through clinical strategy design. While the focus will be on utilizing predictive modelling to support neurology-related translational science, the candidate will also be providing general bioinformatics expertise to help directly guide therapeutic research across a variety of programs and platforms.

Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in America. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians (Groups), technologists (Athena, Hudson River Trading) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to America's future health. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz and AlleyCorp.  We are launching Pearl Health to help PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. Over time, this solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients, increasing their autonomy, creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence, and making risk more available and more readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is launching a new value-based care program to disrupt Traditional Medicare, and we believe that this represents an opportunity to achieve the meaningful change we envision.  What we hope you can do...  We are seeking a brilliant Data Scientist with a track record of propeling business strategies through analytical insights and algorithmic systems.

Who you are…  3-5 years of experience in performing results-driven quantitative analysis in a collaborative environment.  Degree in statistics, applied math, computer science, engineering or a related field.  SQL expertise and strong foundation in at least one of the main data science programming languages. Python is our current primary language and is preferred.  Experience manipulating messy and inconsistent data sets, performing statistical analyses, and presenting insights in an easily-accessible and timely fashion.  A proven ability to conduct research and empower data-driven aspects of our product through a mix of internal resources and external vendors, especially in AI, ML and NLP domains.  Experience collaborating with data engineering teams to define needs for an ETL pipeline and familiarity with the most common ETL tools.
