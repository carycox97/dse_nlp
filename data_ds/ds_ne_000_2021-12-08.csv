We want people who love finding compelling patterns within big data, finding the story buried in the data, and communicating insights and opportunities. We seek people who want to join a team of data scientists in developing data-discovery tools and creative approaches to interpretation of data, to move both Alorica, its clients, and its customers. What You Will Do Alorica data scientists work remotely on a range of strategic projects, to inform executive decision-making, to support internal operations, and to improve client performance. Beyond technical skills, you will need to be able to design research studies, exercise business judgement in prioritizing your efforts, and communicate with team members in the United States or non-technical colleagues. While transactional data may be structured and within a data warehouse, nearly every project will require that you merge external structured or semi-structured data or create your own data pool. Sometimes, you will spend a significant amount of time trying to figure out what data exist, who can help you get it, and how to transform it to become more useful. The data you work with may be incomplete, or require you to cleanse or process it, and develop a scholarship over its limitations. Like traditional business analysts, you will use query skills and statistical packages such as SQL, R, and Python. You will also deploy and manage solutions in production environments. Some projects will require machine learning techniques, such as random forest decision trees, topic modeling, similarity indexes, and deep data mining. The best tools and techniques to use change project-by-project, and if there is one certainty, it is that you will need to teach yourself new skills along the way. Qualifications  What you need 2+ years industry experience in data science or related field. A bachelor's degree in quantitative discipline: statistics, operations research, mathematics, economics, or finance is preferred. We will consider degrees from other programs provided candidates have significant technical experience and skills. Master's degree or Ph.D. a plus.
