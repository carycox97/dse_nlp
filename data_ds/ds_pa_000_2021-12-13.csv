The type of problems we solve at SIG are often different from the subject of your PhD thesis, but nonetheless, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding. The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea: This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria. As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming. Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal. You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production. Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance. As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas. Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.  What we're looking for  PhD degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably Experience working on in-depth research projects Finance experience is a plus, but not required By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Strategist position.

The opportunity to develop solutions for societal challenges are unbounded. The director will catalyze university-wide interdisciplinary research for innovation in the broad area of artificial intelligence. The faculty seek a colleague who will connect investigators from diverse backgrounds and unite them in pursuing novel research directions, which will simultaneously advance the field of AI research while increasing recognition of Penn State as a leading university in AI.

It is an ambitious  vision  that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of  machine   learning  and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat. The AIML Sequence  Learning  Team applies  machine   learning  and AI methods to DNA and RNA sequence  data  from large-scale human genetic, functional  genomic  and single  cell  experiments. DNA sequence variations are linked to disease via changes in the nature and abundance of protein and RNA gene products. The Sequence  Learning  group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other  data  sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone. This is an exciting methodological advance at the intersection of  NLP  inspired language models applied to biological  data . We're looking for a highly accomplished  AI/ ML   Engineer  to join our team.
