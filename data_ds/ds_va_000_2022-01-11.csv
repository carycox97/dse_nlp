Founded in December 2018, we've rapidly grown to over 1 million customers.  It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.  We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.  We get it -  life happens . That's why Mission Lane is hard at work paving a better way forward.

The Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG) of Virginia Commonwealth University is hiring a 2-year term postdoctoral researcher as early as January 2022. VIPBG offers a rich multidisciplinary training environment in molecular and statistical genetics, epidemiology, psychology, and psychiatry. Training is tailored to the experience and needs of the fellow, and has an emphasis on collaborative research. The primary research aim of this fellowship is to leverage large-scale genetic and biobank data to advance the understanding of risk factors for psychiatric disorders including major depression and alcohol use disorder. We are seeking a data scientist with an interest in applying statistical genetics and machine learning to large-scale genetic studies. Strong candidates will have excellent programming and data analytic skills, knowledge of statistics, familiarity with genome informatics tools, and a strong publication record. Statistical genetics experience and/or expertise in machine learning methods is preferred, but interested applicants are encouraged to apply regardless of past training experiences. The appointed researcher will work full-time on the development and implementation of computational models, and their interpretation. The fellow will take advantage of large sets of genomic, clinical, and behavioral data derived from a wide variety of large-scale studies. We have world class collaborations locally, nationally, and abroad to support a rich training experience. Current projects include analyses conducted in the context of international consortia: UK Biobank, Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and Lifelines. The research fellow will contribute to NIH funded research projects including adapting machine learning methods to estimate risk to strictly defined major depression in large-scale biobanks samples that measure many variables but may not contain rigorous clinical assessments and use these predictions to discover additional genetic variation specifically influencing major depression. The fellow will also be invited to join the VCU Alcohol Research Center P50 project that investigates the genetic architecture of Alcohol Use Disorder by leveraging cross-trait genetic correlations and next generation sequencing studies. The appointed fellow will be mentored by a multidisciplinary team involving leaders in human genetics (Drs.
