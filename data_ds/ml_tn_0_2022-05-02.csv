As an independent branch of Frontdoor, ProConnect operates with the flexibility and freedom of a startup, but with the financial stability and backing of a 50 year-old, publicly traded company. As a member of the ProConnect team, you will have a direct impact on the success of our product.      This position is a 100% REMOTE Quality Assurance Engineer role, working in both backend and frontend systems that leverage the latest technologies (Golang, React, Node, Docker, etc).

We value people as our most valuable asset, and work together to ensure an interesting and rewarding career.

We welcome discussions, feedback, and ideas from every individual on the team, regardless of role, tenure, or seniority. We believe that quality is owned by the entire team (not just the QA department). As a Quality Engineer, you have unique experience and expertise to help us identify areas we should consider and focus on, and we welcome your contributions in any setting.        We Are Transparent:  As a quality engineer on the team, you are expected to be an equal contributor to the success and quality of our product, and are empowered to raise issues and concerns as you identify them at any point in our development process (and not just when they enter the testing phase).

As a new initiative at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital (SJCRH), its mission is to serve the research community by delivering high-quality, fully-characterized, patient-derived, pluripotent cells. Our aim is to generate these cells on our fully-automated, state of the art, robotic system. Our methodologies are based on the Nobel Prize winning work of Shinya Yamanaka, which culminated in the ability to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from terminally-differentiated human somatic cells such as skin cells, blood cells and urine cells. These iPSCs permit the derivation of both normal and disease phenotype, patient-matched cell lines, and are therefore key to developing personalized medicine approaches:  iPSCs provide a vital tool to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in patient-specific responses to treatments, and in the future will form the basis of creating patient-derived, patient-matched cellular therapeutics . There are opportunities to develop bioinformatics and data analysis skills, including running machine learning pipelines to evaluate microscope images of developing iPSC colonies. Our automation system includes the latest model instruments: Hamilton Vantage; Hamilton LabElite Decapper; Bionex Centrifuge; Cytation 5; Cytomat (500 capacity); KingFisher Flex; F7 robotic arm and a BioStore III Liquid Nitrogen Freezer.  As CMPD establishes our methodologies and implements our automation we seek an exceptional, self-motivated individual with experience in either cell biology with preferred expertise in robotics and automation or someone with a Biomedical or electrical engineering background that enjoys the thrill of working with a multidisciplinary team to create solutions that automates a series of manual cell culture workflows to aid in increasing stem cell reprogramming throughout.
