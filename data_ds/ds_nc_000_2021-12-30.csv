The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country. What the EPA project is about The Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) supports ORD by providing solutions-driven research to rapidly evaluate the potential human health and environmental risks due to exposures to environmental stressors and ensure the integrity of the freshwater environment and its capacity to support human well-being. CCTE researchers are developing and applying cutting edge innovations in methods to rapidly evaluate chemical toxicity, transport, and exposure to people and environments. Within CCTE, the Chemical Characterization and Exposure Division (CCED) performs research to develop and advance analytical chemistry, computational chemistry, and cheminformatic approaches that are critical to the rapid characterization of the presence, structural characteristics, and properties of chemicals that underlie chemical exposure, environmental fate, toxicokinetics and toxicity.  What experience and skills will you gain? As a team member, you will support research under the Chemical Safety for Sustainability (CSS) research program on enhancing the Generalized Read-across (GenRA) workflow to address other similarity contexts beyond structural similarity.  Read-across is a data gap filling technique used within analogue and category approaches where information on a (source) substance is used to infer the same property for a similar (target) substance. Read-across approaches are traditionally expert driven subjective assessments and as such it is difficult to quantify their performance. The Generalized Read-across (GenRA) approach developed and published in 2016 (Shah et al., 2016) aimed to investigate new ways of performing objective read-across predictions from which a baseline in performance could be quantified. GenRA has since been implemented as a webtool GenRA within the EPA Chemicals CompTox Dashboard (Helman et al., 2019). This work has been an ongoing collaboration between 2 divisions within CCTE leveraging the advances in computational toxicological data such as high throughput screening, high throughput transcriptomic and high throughput phenotypic profiling (so-called New Approach Methodologies (NAM) data) in conjunction with chemistry knowledge to make  in vivo  toxicity predictions. The current research focus on GenRA is to evaluate the contribution of NAM data to characterize different similarity contexts and their role in informing  in vivo  toxicity predictions. The GenRA approach involves using a fingerprint representation of a substance (either chemical or NAM based) and using it to identify ‘similar’ substances with associated toxicity data to make a read-across prediction. You will further develop the GenRA approach to evaluate other NAM data and develop prototypes to implement the insights derived.   Location:   This job will be located EPA’s facility in Research Triangle Park, NC. Salary:  Selected applicant will become a temporary employee of ORAU and will receive an hourly wage of $30.16 for hours worked. Hours:  Full-time.

Responsibilities: How you will apply your skills  Research-related responsibilities : Development of modelling data sets using both experimental and  in silico  data sources. This will require compiling new data extracted from the literature (e.g. following literature reviews), generating new data by running different  in silico  prediction tools and querying data stored in existing MySQL/Mongo databases. Note: Some MySQL databases are best queried using custom made R packages. Developing GenRA and other models to predict toxicity outcomes from chemical structure and NAM data. Read-across analyses will be performed in Python using Jupyter notebooks Other modelling approaches may include random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (kNN), artificial neural networks (ANN) Read-across and other models will be written using existing GenRA code and other machine learning libraries in Python Applying other  in silico  tools e.g. OECD Toolbox which encodes (Q)SAR and structural alert information to generate relevant  in silico  predictions and molecular descriptor information.

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting.

That means we connect customers with multiple lenders, so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders, so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more.   What else you should know:   We’re a publicly-traded company (TREE).  We’ve welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.  We’ve built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.  We still make funny commercials.
