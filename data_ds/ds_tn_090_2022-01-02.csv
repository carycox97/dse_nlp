We're looking for a  Senior Business Data Analyst  to help him scale Minno.  Minno was founded just over two years ago by Erick Goss and Dan Raines. They recognized that most Christian parents were frustrated with their media options. The audience was looking for shows and streaming options that reflected their faith and values, designed specifically for kids. With a desire to provide the tools to delight and disciple the next generation of Christians, Minno was born.  In the short time we've been around, we have built a business experiencing significant year-over-year growth and whose staff has grown to more than 20 employees. Our team is composed of top executives from brand-name e-commerce and content companies.  Minno serves families through Minno Kids, an ad-free, streaming video app, our children's book publishing unit, and Minno Life (a parent resource site and home of the Raising Boys & Girls podcast). Minno strives to create a high-performance, supportive culture where you can do the best work of your life. We recently received TINYpulse's 2020 Happiest Award.  Minno differentiates itself in three areas:   Kids first: Minno is the only platform focused exclusively on serving Christian kids and their parents. Kids are first-class citizens at Minno, not just a secondary design consideration.  Faith first: We focus on faith development vs. just entertainment. We are the only platform focused on bringing the best of media, technology, and spirituality together.  Transmedia, not just screens: Parents are looking for more than just redemptive screen time. They are looking for off-screen experiences for their kids and better resources for themselves. We are unique in our effort to address this need.
