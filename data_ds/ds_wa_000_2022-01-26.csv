We are seeking a Machine Learning Engineer II to help us design, build, and deploy software systems that leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve problems in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), search, and data analytics. We need innovative problem solvers and have the experience and expertise to bridge the gap between machine learning research and practical, mission-driven applications. Ideal candidates have a mixture of machine learning expertise and a solid understanding of developing and deploying production software systems.

When the feature is complete, you verify that the build passes in the CI system and submit a PR for your teammates to review. After that, you have a standup with the project team and then a meeting with the project data scientist to discuss solutions for improving the performance of an existing NER model on a certain class of inputs for which it is performing poorly. After your meetings, you adjust some labels on the input dataset based on the data scientist's feedback, retrain the model, and see that it is performing much better than the previous version. You tag the new model and trigger a deployment to update the new model's staging application. After lunch, you context switch to your other project where you are evaluating a new vector database that you hope will help improve the functionality of image similarity search by enabling users to filter images before ranking them. You get the Docker container running and then work through a tutorial to figure out how to load feature vectors and metadata. When you go home you see an article in your news feed discussing an emerging national security concern that directly relates to your project, and you are happy knowing that your work has a real impact on something important.

Together, we'll continue to democratize the law and make a real difference in the lives of millions. Overview The Data Science and Engineering team at LegalZoom helps us make measurably better decisions, faster. We do this through everything from shaping our product strategy to running experiments that let us know how well our strategy is performing. In this role, you will work closely with the Partnerships business to help them make data-driven decisions. The goal is to help customers build successful businesses by identifying and delivering offers from LegalZoom partners. Whether that offer is a business license, insurance, or any of our other partner offerings, your work is critical to providing the customer the right option at the right time. You will move nimbly between 1st and 3rd-party data sources and provide insights to Partner Managers and partners. You will work very closely with our colleagues in Engineering on everything from helping them build data-driven products to making sure that we are taking advantage of the latest advancements in data infrastructure (we are in the midst of migrating our data stack to the cloud). Examples of questions you’ll tackle include how do customers discover and opt-in to our partner offers, how can targeting improve conversion rates, and what other products and partner placements we should launch.

You can’t stop asking “why” until you get to the truth. Sees the Big Picture but Sweats the Details  – You never lose sight of why the work you're doing matters. At the same time, you know that the devil is in the details. When working with a new set of data for the first time, you trust but verify that data are correct and make sense. But above all, you always true back to the original question and make sure you’re making progress in answering it. Speaks Up  - Being right a lot is important but only if it leads to others taking action. You speak up - especially when it seems controversial to do so - because you know that we’re all trying to do the right thing and want the best ideas to win. Technically Sound  – Your code is easy to read and is correct. You know SQL really well and can probably write some Python or R. You can use visualization tools such as Tableau or Superset to produce straightforward visualizations that people can understand. Your colleagues like working with the things you’ve built because they’re thoughtfully designed and well-constructed. Analytically Sound  – Your use of data and analytical techniques is sound. You understand the statistical underpinnings of experimentation and can design robust experiments. You define metrics that capture relevant customer behaviors in a way that doesn’t mislead. The models you build get the most predictive power out of the data because you understand how the techniques you’re using work and know how to transform data so that those techniques are most effective. Sometimes you break the rules but you know the rules and have a principled reason for why you are doing so. Good Learner  - There is far more out there to know than any one of us can know but if given a little time you can pick up whatever it is you need to know to do the job. You efficiently seek answers for yourself but also know when to ask for help. Intentional  – You know what your priorities are and why they are your priorities. When asked to help with something, you seek to understand why it is important and consider whether it makes sense to engage before saying yes. Relevant Experience  – You've done something like this before. Whether it be a previous role in data science and analytics or something where you had to demonstrate the above qualities, at the staff level we need you to have some prior experience. In some cases, this can come from your academic background which is probably something STEM or with a quantitative bent.
