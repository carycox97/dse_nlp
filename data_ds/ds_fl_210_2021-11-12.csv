The University of Florida, ranked No. 5 best public university, has launched an initiative to become the world’s top university in the study and teaching of artificial intelligence. The centerpiece of this initiative is the acquisition of the most powerful supercomputer in U.S. higher education, which is available to all UF faculty. The UF College of Journalism and Communications (CJC) has a strong foundation of AI work, particularly around identification and elimination of misinformation, trust in AI, equitable AI, and human-machine communication. The Opportunity The College of Journalism and Communications at the University of Florida, one of the premier communication programs in the country, invites applications for two nine-month tenure-track/tenured positions, to be hired at either an assistant or associate professor level, dependent on qualifications. The appointment is to begin Fall 2022. One position will focus on the role and impact of artificial intelligence in the news media. One position will focus on the role and impact of artificial intelligence in strategic communication. These faculty members will work in partnership with UF’s Consortium on Trust in Media and Technology, which is based at CJC. The Consortium is distinctive in its response to the global trust crisis, connecting scholars and thought leaders across disciplines to conduct research and develop applications supporting media and technology that is credible and equitable. Its interdisciplinary approach provides opportunities to work with colleagues at CJC, UF and the field more broadly, helping to build an unparalleled ecosystem of scholars and practitioners. The Consortium’s work is part of UF’s commitment to artificial intelligence as the centerpiece of a major, long-term initiative combining world-class research infrastructure, cutting-edge research, and a transformational approach to curriculum.
