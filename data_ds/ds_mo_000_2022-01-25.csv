More than just a company, Balto is a community, a community committed to empowering each of our members and serving our community. This mission is at the heart of our organization.  Balto's Real-Time Guidance understands phone conversations and tells people what to say, live in their conversations. In 2018, Balto guided fewer than 1 million conversations; today, Balto has guided over 50 million conversations (we celebrated with cake). By the end of this year, Balto will guide over 200M conversations.  Real-time Guidance is a brand new product category, and Balto is leading the pack. We're making sure that humans understand each other - the opportunities are endless.  Balto's customers, including name-brand retailers and Fortune 500s, use Balto's real-time guidance technology to scale ""perfect"" to thousands of sales and service agents with the push of a button and get immediate insight into what's working on their phone calls and what's not.  But enough about us, let's talk about you!  Here's what an NLP Engineer does at Balto:  Balto is seeking experienced Natural Language Processing Engineers to take our industry-leading real-time NLP engine and drive it into the next frontier. Leveraging our massive conversational datasets, you’ll design, train, and deploy NLP models that will power core features of Balto’s real-time conversational analytics. You’ll have the opportunity to contribute to the strategic direction for new NLP-based product features and the autonomy to design and implement novel models to address the complex challenges associated with real-time analytic systems.  As a member of our speech and language processing team, you’ll work on a cross-functional team of full-stack, NLP, and speech engineers to tackle complex challenges at the intersection of speech and language modeling for dialogues. Additionally, you’ll work closely with our DevOps group to deploy new models as scalable model services using industry standard tools.  What kinds of responsibilities might you take on?   Design and develop novel and state-of-the-art NLP models for text and token classification, dialogue segmentation, and other NLP use cases to be implemented as new product features  Deploy model services as scalable, containerized microservices  Work closely with other team members to maintain our end-to-end speech and language processing pipelines  Own the lifecycle of machine learning pipelines on top of large-scale, automated data integration processes, including training data acquisition and curation as well as continuous monitoring of model performance metrics  Interact directly with members of our product, engineering, and data science teams at various stages of the product development cycle  Collaborate with industry experts that have patents in globally distributed data processing, speech-to-text software, natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence   So what does it take to fulfill this crucial role?   3-5 years of experience in developing NLP-driven applications that drive business or scientific value  Experience working within a product-focused, cross-functional engineering team  Masters or Ph.D. with experience defining and addressing complex quantitative problems through software engineering  Commitment to using source control, code review, style guide compliance, and modular development  Experience with text classification, token classification, and related NLP tasks and associated use cases (sentiment analysis, NER, etc.)  Familiarity with traditional NLP techniques for preprocessing and vectorizing text, as well as modern deep learning architectures such as transformers  Experience developing custom architectures with tensorflow or pytorch, and utilizing common NLP packages such as spacy, nltk, and huggingface  Familiarity with using resource in cloud platforms such as object and with containerization services such as Docker  Ability to articulate complex ideas clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders   Additional skills that will make you stand out:   Experience working with conversational dialogues, ideally downstream from automatic speech recognition systems  Experience deploying containerized model services with kubernetes  Experience developing and integrating machine learning models in systems with strict latency requirements  Experience curating training and validation datasets for text-based machine learning tasks   We have plenty of benefits. Baltonians rave about these the most.   Medical, dental, and vision insurance to make quality healthcare affordable  Life insurance to protect your loved ones in the worst-case scenario  401k to save for your retirement  Unlimited Paid Time Off to give you the flexibility to make relaxation, family, and community priorities  Parental leave for you to spend that precious time with your newest family member  Generous stock options, so you can be a meaningful owner of the company as it grows  A quarterly professional development of stipend of  $1,000  to inspire continuous professional growth. You can use it for nearly anything that makes you a better version of yourself - from chess lessons to college courses (this one is definitely a crowd-favorite)   Balto's Values  Start with gratitude: Stay humble, recognize others, and make the most of everything.  Always be growing: Never stop learning. Be a force of growth for yourself and others.  Leadership is Ownership: See the problem. Do the solution. Own the result.  Balto's People  We have all kinds of people, including musicians, chefs, painters, gear heads, gardeners, philosophers, gamers, movie buffs, woodworkers, and polo players. And at least one aspiring hockey player... we'll see.   Baltonians say things like:   ""Coming together as a team to build something innovative and unique.""  ""Contagious energy that keeps me motivated all day.""  ""I L-O-V-E it at Balto since day one! They know how to have fun while getting the work done.""   Is Balto named after that Cartoon Dog?  Well, kind of - that cartoon dog was actually named after a real dog. Balto successfully guided his pack through a harrowing journey across Nome, Alaska, in 1925 to deliver medicine to the ice-locked town. We liked the metaphor: our technology guides people to be successful throughout their conversations, scouting ahead and providing helpful support. Just like in 1925, a human is still in charge, but humans (and dogs) are always better off with a companion.  Fun Fact:  After his journey, Balto was recognized as a hero with a commemorative statue in Central Park. We've visited, and he looked like this.  P.S.  Please share the role with your friends. Don't worry; you won't compete for the position; we're happy to hire two (or more) candidates. The door is always open for great people.  Balto is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate against any applicant based on race, color, religion, creed, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual preference, age, and veteran or disability status.",11 days ago,

If you're excited by the opportunity to join a dynamic team initiating a technological revolution in Real-Time Guidance, Balto is for you.  More than just a company, Balto is a community, a community committed to empowering each of our members and serving our community. This mission is at the heart of our organization.  Balto's Real-Time Guidance understands phone conversations and tells people what to say, live in their conversations. In 2018, Balto guided fewer than 1 million conversations; today, Balto has guided over 50 million conversations (we celebrated with cake). By the end of this year, Balto will guide over 200M conversations.  Real-time Guidance is a brand new product category, and Balto is leading the pack. We're making sure that humans understand each other - the opportunities are endless.  Balto's customers, including name-brand retailers and Fortune 500s, use Balto's real-time guidance technology to scale ""perfect"" to thousands of sales and service agents with the push of a button and get immediate insight into what's working on their phone calls and what's not.  But enough about us, let's talk about you!  Here's what an NLP Engineer does at Balto:  Balto is seeking experienced Natural Language Processing Engineers to take our industry-leading real-time NLP engine and drive it into the next frontier. Leveraging our massive conversational datasets, you'll design, train, and deploy NLP models that will power core features of Balto's real-time conversational analytics. You'll have the opportunity to contribute to the strategic direction for new NLP-based product features and the autonomy to design and implement novel models to address the complex challenges associated with real-time analytic systems.  As a member of our speech and language processing team, you'll work on a cross-functional team of full-stack, NLP, and speech engineers to tackle complex challenges at the intersection of speech and language modeling for dialogues. Additionally, you'll work closely with our DevOps group to deploy new models as scalable model services using industry standard tools.  What kinds of responsibilities might you take on?   Design and develop novel and state-of-the-art NLP models for text and token classification, dialogue segmentation, and other NLP use cases to be implemented as new product features  Deploy model services as scalable, containerized microservices  Work closely with other team members to maintain our end-to-end speech and language processing pipelines  Own the lifecycle of machine learning pipelines on top of large-scale, automated data integration processes, including training data acquisition and curation as well as continuous monitoring of model performance metrics  Interact directly with members of our product, engineering, and data science teams at various stages of the product development cycle  Collaborate with industry experts that have patents in globally distributed data processing, speech-to-text software, natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence   So what does it take to fulfill this crucial role?   3-5 years of experience in developing NLP-driven applications that drive business or scientific value  Experience working within a product-focused, cross-functional engineering team  Masters or Ph.D. with experience defining and addressing complex quantitative problems through software engineering  Commitment to using source control, code review, style guide compliance, and modular development  Experience with text classification, token classification, and related NLP tasks and associated use cases (sentiment analysis, NER, etc.)  Familiarity with traditional NLP techniques for preprocessing and vectorizing text, as well as modern deep learning architectures such as transformers  Experience developing custom architectures with tensorflow or pytorch, and utilizing common NLP packages such as spacy, nltk, and huggingface  Familiarity with using resource in cloud platforms such as object and with containerization services such as Docker  Ability to articulate complex ideas clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders   Additional skills that will make you stand out:   Experience working with conversational dialogues, ideally downstream from automatic speech recognition systems  Experience deploying containerized model services with kubernetes  Experience developing and integrating machine learning models in systems with strict latency requirements  Experience curating training and validation datasets for text-based machine learning tasks   We have plenty of benefits. Baltonians rave about these the most.   Medical, dental, and vision insurance to make quality healthcare affordable  Life insurance to protect your loved ones in the worst-case scenario  401k to save for your retirement  Unlimited Paid Time Off to give you the flexibility to make relaxation, family, and community priorities  Parental leave for you to spend that precious time with your newest family member  Generous stock options, so you can be a meaningful owner of the company as it grows  A quarterly professional development of stipend of  $1,000  to inspire continuous professional growth. You can use it for nearly anything that makes you a better version of yourself - from chess lessons to college courses (this one is definitely a crowd-favorite)   Balto's Values  Start with gratitude: Stay humble, recognize others, and make the most of everything.  Always be growing: Never stop learning. Be a force of growth for yourself and others.  Leadership is Ownership: See the problem. Do the solution. Own the result.  Balto's People  We have all kinds of people, including musicians, chefs, painters, gear heads, gardeners, philosophers, gamers, movie buffs, woodworkers, and polo players. And at least one aspiring hockey player... we'll see.  You can read more about their experiences here and here.  Baltonians say things like:   ""Coming together as a team to build something innovative and unique.""  ""Contagious energy that keeps me motivated all day.""  ""I L-O-V-E it at Balto since day one! They know how to have fun while getting the work done.""   Is Balto named after that Cartoon Dog?  Well, kind of - that cartoon dog was actually named after a real dog. Balto successfully guided his pack through a harrowing journey across Nome, Alaska, in 1925 to deliver medicine to the ice-locked town. We liked the metaphor: our technology guides people to be successful throughout their conversations, scouting ahead and providing helpful support. Just like in 1925, a human is still in charge, but humans (and dogs) are always better off with a companion.  Fun Fact:  After his journey, Balto was recognized as a hero with a commemorative statue in Central Park. We've visited, and he looked like this.  P.S.  Please share the role with your friends. Don't worry; you won't compete for the position; we're happy to hire two (or more) candidates. The door is always open for great people.
