For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible. For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. The best fit for the role is someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications. This is a full-time role. We are based in New York, but welcome remote applications from everywhere About the company Runway is building the next generation of creative tools. We are a small team of artists, engineers, developers, and researchers working together to predict-by-inventing the future. Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford. We have built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become  smarter  in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old  Creative Suite  for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in  how  we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.  Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú. We are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.  Requirements: Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM). Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight. Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV. Experience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. Opinionated about writing robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs.

For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible.

You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments.

And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become  smarter  in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old  Creative Suite  for way too long.

As an Agile Delivery Manager, you will help our product & engineering org work cross-functionally and collaboratively as we journey through this next stage of growth.  Being a startup (albeit one that’s growing quickly) - we are looking for that balance between player & coach, so facilitating positive outcomes, driving change, and leading with empathy are really important but rolling up your sleeves and getting into the thick of things (across the software development lifecycle) are equally as critical.  We would love to have conversations with scrum masters, agile delivery managers, delivery managers, delivery leads, agile coaches, technical project managers & more.  What will you be doing as our Agile Delivery Manager?

A fair understanding of the entire product delivery process, from ideation to delivery  You consider yourself a lifelong learner, inspiring those around you to gain a better understanding of everything related to software product development.  A delivery orientated mind-set, we are not looking for a pure hands off scrum master, we need someone who wants to get into the detail, the context, & the platform itself (Cutover) & own the features that your squad(s) build.   The good stuff...   You’ll be given a solid compensation plan. We want all of our team members to feel a genuine sense of ownership in what we're building here at Cutover.

Brookhaven Lab is a multidisciplinary laboratory with seven Nobel Prize-winning discoveries, 37 R&D 100 Awards, and more than 70 years of pioneering research. The Lab is primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Science. Brookhaven Science Associates (BSA) operates and manages the Laboratory for DOE. BSA is a partnership between Battelle and The Research Foundation for the State University of New York on behalf of Stony Brook University. BSA salutes our veterans and active military members with careers that leverage the skills and unique experience they gained while serving our country. Our organization fully supports service members transitioning from active duty to civilian life and pledge’s our commitment to actively hire veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. Military personnel who have been formally trained or have relevant experience obtained while in service may meet educational requirements and are encouraged to apply for job opportunities at BSA. Organizational Overview Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Nuclear Science and Technology Department conducts research and development related to nuclear technologies (reactors and accelerator-driven systems), reliability and risk assessment, and advanced modeling techniques for reactor simulation and energy systems. The Department serves as a resource in these and related areas to support the missions of the Department of Energy (DOE), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other national and international organizations. With a world-class staff of professionals with expertise in a broad range of areas related to the design and analyses of commercial, research and advanced nuclear systems, Brookhaven’s capabilities and facilities are also available to support and execute experiments in support of these missions. The National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC), a part of BNL’s Nuclear Science and Technology Department, is the lead unit of the US Nuclear Data Program (USNDP), whose mission is to provide current, accurate, authoritative data for workers in pure and applied areas of nuclear science and engineering. This is accomplished primarily through the compilation, evaluation, dissemination, and archiving of extensive nuclear datasets. USNDP also addresses gaps in the data, through targeted experimental studies and the use of theoretical models. The NNDC is responsible for the Nuclear Science Reference (NSR), eXperimental Unevaluated Nuclear Data List (XUNDL), Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF) and Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF) libraries, as well as the Nuclear Data Sheets journal.
