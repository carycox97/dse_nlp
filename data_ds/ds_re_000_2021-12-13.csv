Hybrid remote working available. Chesapeake Conservancy, a nonprofit organization based in Annapolis, Maryland, is seeking a Geospatial Data Scientist with experience leveraging machine learning and large and complex data sets in the environmental world. About The Conservancy Chesapeake Conservancy is a nonprofit organization based in Annapolis, Maryland. We are conservation entrepreneurs. We believe that the Chesapeake is a national treasure that should be accessible for everyone and a place where wildlife can thrive. We use technology to enhance the pace and quality of conservation, and we help build parks, trails, and public access sites. Chesapeake Conservancy works in close partnership with the National Park Service Chesapeake Bay Office, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as other federal, state, and local agencies, private foundations, and corporations to advance conservation. Within the Conservancy, the Conservation Innovation Center (CIC) was established in 2013 to advance cutting-edge technology to empower data-driven conservation and restoration. Through regional and national partnerships, the CIC makes data analysis and insights accessible for restoration professionals to practice precision conservation, yielding greater impact with fewer resources. The CIC’s Data Science Team has recognized the potential of machine learning to dramatically improve the analysis of large and complex datasets to improve environmental decision making. We have completed the development of an AI system for prediction of wetlands and have trained an AI model for prediction of ten land-cover classes, both at high spatial resolution (1m). The team is embarking on an ambitious project about biodiversity in the face of climate change; this project will model the fine-scale distribution of species with sophisticated machine learning models.
