This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]      About Quora:      The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.      About the Team:      The Data Team is highly empowered at Quora, helping navigate complexity and influencing product and company strategy directly. Quora's outsized commitment to data is visible in everything we do, from our rigor-driven experimentation processes to the backgrounds of our leaders (including many Product Managers and the Head of Product being former full-time data scientists). With this emphasis on data and empirics, we aim to balance rigor and pragmatism, searching for scrappy solutions in pursuit of our mission. In joining Quora's strong data team, you'll both benefit from and work to advance our culture of rational decision making.      About the Role:      As a data scientist, you'll work closely with product managers, product designers, and engineers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, build visualizations, and tackle hard, open-ended problems that uncover usage patterns and opportunities for the company. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. Examples of some projects our data scientists have worked on include modeling our long-term growth, improving the relevance and personalization of the homepage feed, and exploratory analysis of factors driving question-asking behavior. For more about our work, see Quora's Data blog at https://data.quora.com/.      Responsibilities:         Extract actionable insights from broad, open-ended questions      Create dashboards and develop metrics to track the success and growth of the product      Design and evaluate experiments to measure the impact of product changes      Analyze data from across the product to uncover the root causes of metric movements      Use Python and SQL to draw insights from data at scale      Communicate results to cross-functional stakeholders to inform product decisions      Develop tools to scale and automate analyses, improving productivity across the company      Improve the work of other data scientists through mentorship and by bringing industry best practices to the team        Minimum Qualifications:         Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time).

Technological change and the digitization of all kinds of data (company, economic, and human data) are reshaping businesses, the global economy, and societies around the world. Design and innovation are creating new value for stakeholders. At the same time these technologies are creating significant turmoil and turbulence for companies, executives, workers and societies.              To (re)invent how companies will compete and thrive in this new world and to educate the next generation of business leaders, Harvard Business School (HBS) is launching the D3 Institute: the Digital, Data, and Design Institute.              The Institute will enable companies to be more competitive in the age of AI and spur the formation of new organizations; it will position HBS and Harvard as a global leader in digital, innovation, and business.              What will the D3 Institute focus on? Rigorous research, immersive scaled learning, and cutting-edge practice. In close partnership with organizations impacted by digital transformation, the Institute will pursue technical research in data science and machine learning alongside research examining broader business and societal implications.              The D3 Institute will also serve as a catalyst for the development of new platforms that facilitate meaningful connections between faculty, companies, individuals, inside and outside of HBS: a Learning Network to connect faculty with potential research pursuit, an Observatory to study how digitization is impacting companies, economies and society, a Research and Learning Accelerator to partner with companies, and a Startup Foundry to launch new ventures. Getting the D3 Institute off the ground will require exceptional talent – somebody who wants to play a role in inventing the future of business and has the drive to translate the D3 vision into reality. If the convergence of digital business, data, and design is your passion and your aspiration, we want to hear from you.              As the Launch Director of the D3 Institute, you will be its leader and spokesperson, working closely with the Chair of the Digital, Data & Design (D3) Institute to ensure its success. You and your team will design and implement both a strategic and operational plan to support all D3 research programs and platforms.              Initially, you will build and lead an administrative and research team that will launch new research programs and embedded several labs driving foundational and applied research on critical topics. These topics address the way companies will operate in the digital society of the future, and include: Business Model Transformation, Operating Model Transformation, Organizational and Workforce Transformation, Performance and Metrics, Data, Privacy and Transparency, and Societal Impact.              As the D3 Launch Director, you will work with the D3 Institute Chair and others to also establish a new Data Science and Software Core, assembling a team of exceptional data scientists that can provide cutting-edge technical capabilities to enable faculty research.              Collaboration will be the hallmark of the D3 Institute: collaboration among faculty members, among HBS and Harvard University departments, and within the Institute and beyond. We will rely on you to help build the new platforms connecting faculty with the business world and with academia beyond HBS.              Initially, beginning in Spring 2022, you will focus on a specific set of D3 research programs, including the first set of labs and the Data Science & Software Core. You will also get the first D3 platforms off the ground, i.e. the Learning Network and the Accelerator. To do so, you and your team will identify and establish research collaborations with companies and organizations.

Position Description             The specific responsibilities span from strategic to operational.               As the Launch Director, you will set the overall vision of the Institute in close collaboration with the governing group (the Faculty Chair, Research Program Chairs, senior HBS and Harvard leaders and a high profile advisory board), defining a short- and long-term strategy that reflects a deep understanding of the political, economic, and environmental context.              You will create an operational plan (including personnel hiring and budget) to define priorities and research pilots as shaped by faculty interests, building out the many workstreams of D3. You will help establish a culture in this new organization that welcomes diversity of thought and encourages innovative thinking and inspires quality research.              By partnering with the HBS Tech Board and other senior leaders, you will determine the technology architecture and upgrade the technology infrastructure, establish a Data Science and Software Core, and support the operational plan of the platform teams.              A key part of the job is establishing research collaboration with companies and organizations beyond HBS in close coordination with the Research Program Chairs, the Harvard community, and external Advisory Council. That will entail identifying and addressing key policy considerations, as well as hosting workshops, conferences, and community building events.              Communications within and beyond the Institute will also be a critical function to facilitate research efforts, give voice to diverse needs, share learnings effectively, and represent the work of the Institute with the outside world.

Taking a plan from idea to reality is your forte, as is your ability to prioritize among many competing alternatives and balance divergent needs.         You can accomplish a great deal with a lean staff, as you clearly articulate your decisions and ensure their execution.         Collaboration with diverse stakeholders comes naturally to you and you enjoy serving as a liaison and spokesperson.         Other key skills include self-motivation, creativity and a high comfort level with an evolving agenda.

Pay is powerful. To learn more, visit www.payscale.com           Job Description    What We Do: The Data Science Team focuses on building models that leverage Payscale’s five core compensation datasets to provide accurate, high coverage estimates of compensation ranges for jobs across industries and the globe. We use modeling techniques such as Bayesian linear regression, hierarchical modeling, transfer learning, NLP, and embeddings to model how different jobs are related to each other in order to produce good compensation range predictions. We do a mix of development on well-defined projects and greenfield innovation on our own ideas. We build internal tools (APIs and interactive demos (using e.g. streamlit)) to exhibit our work. We value teamwork, learning together, maintainability, documentation, and giving clear presentations about our work to non-ML stakeholders. We are generalist problem solvers—we use (or learn!) the best tool for the problem. Our team is remote with some team members working out of offices in Seattle, WA and Burlington, MA periodically.     Our team works closely with compensation domain experts to help define the problems, identify and validate our assumptions, and evaluate our predictions. We are supported by a separate Data Engineering Team that helps turn our models into production APIs for use in products across Payscale’s portfolio.     What You Do: You will be designing and building machine learning models that provide compensation estimates in low-data scenarios, allow us to quantitatively compare jobs to each other (embeddings, NLP), and quantify the impact that skills and other compensable factors have on pay across jobs, industries, and locations.
