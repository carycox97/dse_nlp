As a global leader in cybersecurity, our team changed the game. Since our inception, our market leading cloud-native platform has offered unparalleled protection against the most sophisticated cyberattacks. We’re looking for people with limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to the customer to join us in shaping the future of cybersecurity. Consistently recognized as a top workplace, CrowdStrike is committed to cultivating an inclusive, remote-first culture that offers people the autonomy and flexibility to balance the needs of work and life while taking their career to the next level. Interested in working for a company that sets the standard and leads with integrity? Join us on a mission that matters - one team, one fight.             About the Team          You'll be joining our MacOS Platform Sensor team supporting CrowdStrike's flagship Falcon endpoint protection platform. This team is responsible for core sensor components both in kernel and user space (C++, Swift). We build and maintain the MacOS sensor, creating and/or building a platform for products and features like Zero Trust Assessment, On Sensor Machine Learning for Malware prevention, Falcon Insight, Falcon Prevent, Falcon Firewall Management, Falcon Device Control, etc.: products that empower customers with prevention, detection, and response capabilities.             About the Role          CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.             The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.             This is a macOS Engineer role in the engineering team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on macOS. Engineers in the team own design and development of core features on the platform.

You'll get the opportunity to work at an institution pushing the boundaries of open data transparency while collaborating with some of the industry’s brightest engineers and data scientists to devise, nurture, and implement cutting-edge solutions to continuously evolving engineering obstacles.                  About You              You are someone who loves to work on ambitious projects and pursues creative technological solutions to generalize patterns, extract connections, and surface relevant information across disparate datasets. You have experience in writing and extending machine learning code and related data services to serve multiple product use cases. You are passionate about code quality, continuous delivery, testing, and observability; frequently collaborating with team members to implement shared development patterns, thus enabling all to work more efficiently.             You have a working expertise in cloud infrastructure and are excited about productionizing research to push the bounds of people’s expectations. You are energized by ambiguity and enjoy finding optimizations in an ever-changing environment. You like working in an environment with multiple tech stacks. You apply an iterative development process, building a system that works end-to-end quickly before improving on it more deeply. You get a rush when you successfully orchestrate and automate several complex systems to work together.                  You’re capable of working with ambiguity in a supportive but autonomous environment and are excited about solving complex problems by distilling them into simple solutions that work. You ground your work in software development frameworks while creating solutions that deliver the best results for user experience (including developer experience). Along the way, you’re comfortable proposing well-thought-out solutions and architectures to both technical and non-technical audiences, taking in stakeholder feedback while advocating for data science approaches that clearly demonstrate actionable, meaningful, and scalable solutions for business problems.                    What to Expect in this Position:             As an individual contributor on the data science team, you will collaborate with our data scientists, data engineers, and application engineers to build and extend our core back-end data systems to support a variety of use cases from analyzing search data, optimizing ranking algorithms, running controlled experiments, building scalable, high-performance models, and orchestrating data pipelines using various NLP, ML, and information retrieval techniques.  You will participate in the full development cycle to design and deploy services to efficiently automate and productionize research solutions — integrating features that evaluate model quality, monitor drift and performance, provide interpretable assessments of recommendations or other model outputs.  You will design processes to initiate validation and retraining and autonomously incorporate human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms into production workflows.  You will marshal various components of data systems from storage to access in order to connect large amounts of historical data from relational and graph databases, custom APIs, and server-side applications.  You will partake in operational responsibility for data science services, performing analysis on infrastructure logs to troubleshoot issues and identify system failures and monitor data quality and event logs to estimate model performance.  You will implement standards for optimization, testing, and tooling; recommending team best practices for deploying infrastructure (Databricks, Neo4j, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes) to support data scientists in the delivery of machine learning models.  You will work across teams to ensure cohesion and collaboration across R&D functions (Devops, Engineering, QA, Data, etc.), explaining model applications for various user needs and advocating for data science solutions while keeping engineering quality and long-term design trade-offs in mind.
