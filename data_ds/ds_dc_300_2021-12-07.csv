Of particular interests are the security of Internet of Things (IoT), sensors networks, wearable devices, mobile phones, robots, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. These IoT devices are most often designed without considering security. Unprotected IoT devices can be used as “stepping stones” by attackers to launch more sophisticated attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). A later stage of APT is the “lateral movement” stage, where attackers use benign computer features to move step-by-step deeper into the network in a stealthy manner.  Emphasis is placed on research related to new techniques for the prediction, prevention, detection, resilience, survival and recovery from IoT attack. This effort pursues mathematical excellence in the following relevant areas which impact IoT cybersecurity: APT; cyber deception; IoT defense-in-depth; and end-to-end determination of security assurance. Theoretical constructs or mathematical abstractions provide a rigorous scientific basis for cyber security because they allow for reasoning quantitatively about cyber-attacks. This opportunity involves the use of several mathematical approaches, including game theory to capture the strategic behavior of malicious adversaries and automatically formulate the optimum policies; graph theory to build and formalize attack-graphs; and adversarial machine learning for adaptation to dynamic change in operating scenario. Limited rationality, incomplete information, imperfect monitoring in distributed networks are among the challenges to be considered.

A nonprofit organization operating in 29 countries, we work with enterprising men and women in the developing world to build competitive farms, businesses and industries. By linking people to information, capital and markets, we have helped millions to create lasting prosperity for their families and communities. Practice Overview TechnoServe’s Impact team is a dynamic and growing unit of global experts in monitoring and evaluation and business insights data, with the mandate of providing highest quality evidence to support decision-making in our projects around the world. We support the use of logical frameworks, timely data reporting, and rapid feedback loops to guide program design and adaptive management. Our work is matrixed with every other business unit in the organization, and we actively coordinate with teams across the office and around the world to support data flow and data use. Job Summary The Data Science Manager supports the Impact Team and other key functional units with first class data management, data analysis, and data visualizations to foster insights about our work. TechnoServe maintains 2 data reporting systems across our 29 country offices: Corporate Measurement for vetting, aggregating, and publishing our impact externally, and Progress Status Reports for internally monitoring the status of projects. The Data Science Manager will play a leading role in backstopping and coordinating these two systems. This will require a deep understanding of data structure, data processing, and software functions to support data flow and interoperability between systems. Additionally, the Data Science Manager will help maintain and develop data systems that respond to the needs of specific projects and the organization as a whole - this will require significant listening, collaboration, and resourcefulness. The Data Science Manager will play a leading role in efforts to identify best practices in data management and lead workstreams related to standardizing database designs. The goal of this position is to bring greater efficiency and ease of data use to the organization, fostering greater engagement with the evidence guiding our impact.

The Data Science Manager will advise teams on the appropriate use of technology, assist teams in setting up their systems, and consolidate knowledge and best practice for MEL technology. Back-end support to existing technology and data gathering systems (25%): TechnoServe maintains two systems through which projects report the results that the Data Science Manager will oversee. The project status report (PSR) is a quarterly routine through which projects share their progress on field activities. The PSR is based in google sheets and requires some knowledge of scripts to maintain. Corporate Measurement (CM) is an annual routine through which TechnoServe reviews and aggregates impact data from across the portfolio. The Data Science Manager will help manage the reporting process, in part by creating tools and tracking systems. This process is currently managed through SalesForce and requires creating data flows between SalesForce and Google Sheets. The Data Science Manager will be responsible for vendor management including billing, relationship management, and developing systems to ensure teams are properly using the technology. The Data Science Manager will be cross trained in some of the technology processes used by the Finance, Information, and Technology (FIT) team (MS SQL and SSIS integrations) in order to serve as a backup to this in rare instances. Developing systems (25% LOE): The Data Science Manager will be involved in efforts to overhaul and consolidate several existing software platforms such as the ones used for Corporate Measurement, the Project Status Report, and the Program Quality Survey. This may include the design process, directly creating the new platform, or supervising consultants.The Data Science Manager  may  be asked to modify existing SalesForce-based systems used by our business development team and other teams (requiring some knowledge of Javascript or APEX). Provide leadership to the global MEL Tech community (10% LOE): The Data Science Manager will provide coordination for a community of full time and part time MEL technology staff by scheduling regular check-in calls and maintaining other forums.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=c825c474db6cc0d3&from=web&vjs=3,410,Opportunity in Machine Learning and Data Science for Buildings,U.S. Department of Energy (DOE),"Washington, DC","Organization  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Reference Code  DOE-EERE-STP-BTO-2020-1200 How to Apply   Description  In 2016, residential and commercial buildings consumed more than 40 percent of the Nation’s total energy and more than 74 percent of the electrical energy, resulting in an estimated annual national energy bill totaling more than $380 billion. Widespread adoption of existing energy-efficiency (EE) building technologies – and the introduction and use of new technologies – could eventually reduce energy use in homes and commercial buildings by 50 percent. This would save almost $200 billion annually on energy bills and help create jobs. BTO’s mission is to support research and development (R&D), validation, and integration of affordable, energy-saving technologies, strategies, analytical tools, and information services to enable industry and others to deploy these at scale to reduce energy use and cost in both new and existing residential and commercial buildings.  In addition to EE, Buildings Technologies Office (BTO) has several additional co-emphases. An important one is demand-flexibility (DF), a building’s ability to responsively shape its electricity draw at time scales ranging from multiple hours to seconds and even sub-seconds in order to support grid stability, reliability, and the efficient use of a variety of generation resources. Grid-interactive Efficient Buildings (GEB) is a cross-cutting BTO initiative aimed at establishing building-based DF as a key grid asset. Other emerging co-emphases include resilience, embodied energy, EE and DF at the neighborhood scale, and a new focus on technologies and strategies that support the building construction and deep renovation process; the latter is led by the Advanced Building Construction (ABC) initiative.  BTO’s Emerging Technologies (ET) Program aims to enable the development of cost-effective technologies that can reduce building energy use intensity by 45 percent by 2030, relative to 2010 EE technologies. The ET Program works towards this goal by supporting early-stage R&D in component technologies for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC&R) and water heating; solid-state lighting; and windows and opaque building envelope. The ET Program also has sub-programs in integration technology areas including Sensors and Controls (S&C).  Machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) are playing increasingly large roles in many sectors and are beginning to make an impact in buildings sectors as well with applications in building control, grid response, equipment and system-level fault detection and diagnostics, measurement and verification (M&V), demand forecasting, planning, and others. BTO’s ET Program seeks a talented and committed individual to help it enhance and expand its use of machine learning and data science throughout its portfolio.  Through this appointment, you will learn how to:  Participate in technical reviews/assessments of proposed research and development plans, conduct technical and economic feasibility analysis, as well as evaluate at a deep technical level the progress and ongoing viability and success potential of projects toward meeting the BTO energy efficiency goals. This includes periodic technical reviews and providing rigorous technical feedback for funded R&D projects; as well as collaborating in the negotiation of statements of work and project management plans with technically rigorous milestones, go/no-go decision points, stage-gates and deliverables for new awards.  Collaborate with BTO staff in the assessment of the state-of-the-art scientific literature and practice in machine learning and data science in building applications and in evaluating the potential of machine learning and data science in various building applications.  Collaborate with BTO staff in developing short, medium, and long term strategies and goals for the use of machine learning and data science in building applications.  Engage integration of BTO’s machine learning and data science activities with other efforts across EERE, DOE, and with external stakeholders.   Selected participants will receive a stipend as support for their living and other expenses during this appointment. Stipend rates are determined by EERE officials and are based on the candidate’s academic and professional background.
