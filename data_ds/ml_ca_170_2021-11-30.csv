https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9e8950e06a36982c&from=web&vjs=3,620,Applied Scientist,Afresh,"San Francisco, CA","Afresh is on a mission to reduce food waste and increase access to nutritious food globally by transforming the fresh food supply chain. Our solution is currently deployed in hundreds of grocery stores across the United States and is on track to reduce 30 million pounds of food waste per year with our existing customers alone. By 2021, we're aiming to reduce food waste by a quarter billion pounds per year.   The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.   We are looking for an Applied Scientist to lead the R&D work at Afresh. You will take your existing knowledge of forecasting, simulation, and stochastic optimization and apply it to the challenging and important problem of perishable inventory control. You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core replenishment system. This will include modeling consumer demand, item-level perishability, and complex multi-echelon supply chains. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.  What you will do:  You will work on improving the core models of our system: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and simulation. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges. You will model the complex problems of inventory decay, promotions, price elasticity, and inventory uncertainty, and implement solutions to multi-stage and multi-echelon inventory optimization problems.  In your first 3 months, you will acquire an encyclopedic knowledge of perishable inventory control and Afresh's core decision making problem. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and simulation tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting, ordering, or simulation models.  By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our core modeling system.  By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core system and led research into new product areas (warehouse level replenishment, production planning).  We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.  What skills and experience do you need?  5+ years of industrial or academic experience building systems that deal with large-scale decision making under uncertainty. Some possible prior research areas are inventory optimization, supply chain management, network optimization, forecasting, game theory, decision analysis, or stochastic and approximate dynamic programming.  Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English and easily translate business requirements into constrained optimization problems.  Ability to independently deliver high quality software implementations of your solutions in the Python data stack (numpy/torch/pandas/etc). Knowing Python before joining is not required.  PhD in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related quantitative field   Founded in 2017, Afresh is the first A.I.-powered fresh food optimization  platform  for grocery chains. We have partnered with several large grocers representing hundreds of stores and >$10B in revenue. Our cutting-edge AI  research  has been published in top journals (e.g., ICML).

AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core. OpenAI is dedicated to putting that alignment of interests first — ahead of profit. To achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. Our investment in diversity, equity, and inclusion is ongoing, executed through a wide range of initiatives, and championed and supported by leadership. At OpenAI, we believe artificial intelligence has the potential to help people solve immense global challenges, and we want the upside of AI to be widely shared. Join us in shaping the future of technology. About the Supercomputing team We believe that  increasing compute  is a huge lever to AI progress. We own the entire process, starting from sourcing and system design of what components go into the machines and how they are networked together. We work with vendors to build and deliver these systems, balancing the constraints of power, cooling, network speed vs size, real estate, cost, and component supply. Once clusters arrive we validate, configure, and maintain the infrastructure for our researchers. OpenAI has a huge compute capacity. You won’t encounter any other organization in the world with as much compute per employee. We are a small team that moves quickly, with access to huge resources, working with a direct impact on the success of OpenAI and, by extension, the field of AI as a whole.

That’s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you’re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you’re ready for JPL. Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence. JPL is unique among NASA Centers in that its staff are Caltech employees yet can access NASA technical resources. Cross-discipline teamwork is standard here: colleagues across JPL's science and engineering organizations and Caltech's academic campus often work together. Learning to speak and understand other disciplines' languages is a doorway to the creativity needed to do what has not been done before. JPL staff are encouraged to create mission concepts that address humanity's core questions through a combination of science and technology. They are supported in developing ideas into proposals and hardware and communicating funded missions' results to the scientific community and the broader public. JPL seeks to employ scientists and engineers who are passionate about lifelong learning and excited to contribute to and lead team efforts. We emphasize the importance of partnering across discipline boundaries and creating a friendly, constructive work environment to overcome space exploration's challenges. JPL postdocs benefit from an informal mentoring network, an annual conference showcasing their results, a dedicated seminar series, exposure to diverse career paths, and social connections across the JPL and Caltech community for advice on housing, childcare, and other aspects of living in southern California. JPL’s Ocean Circulation and Air-Sea Interaction Group is offering an exciting postdoctoral opportunity involving research on applying cloud computing to remote sensing oceanography focusing on satellite altimetry. The postdoc position is jointly supported by the Sentinel-6 project, the NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC), and NASA Physical Oceanography Program. The appointee will carry out research in collaboration with the JPL advisor, Jinbo Wang, resulting in publications in the open literature. It is known that the world ocean plays a vital role in the earth's climate system. Understanding the multiscale aspect of the turbulent ocean is an essential first step toward predicting future climate change. In the past decades, satellite remote sensing, especially satellite altimetry, has played a central role in advancing our understanding of ocean circulation from gyre scale to mesoscale. The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will further advance the resolution of satellite altimetry down to tens of kilometers at smaller mesoscale, where the heat exchanges between deep and upper ocean start to intensify. Golden opportunities lie ahead in the coming decade for studying ocean physics at these small scales, as well as significant challenges: (1) oceanic processes at the smaller mesoscales are intrinsically transient, imposing difficulties in utilizing infrequent satellite snapshots; (2) the volume of the incoming satellite measurements is beyond the conventional workflow based on small local servers; and (3) a synergistic approach is needed to analyze the diverse remote sensing measurements of the ocean surface. The recent advancement in cloud computing, statistical algorithms including machine learning, and realistic global ocean simulations presents an opportunity to address these challenges. The primary responsibility of the position is to create innovative analyses of altimetery measurements and other remote sensing and in-situ data through cloud computing. The innovation can be in data science and/or physical science. The postdoc will also be encouraged to conduct independent research and interact with a team of scientists, data engineers, and machine learning experts at JPL and Caltech. Qualifications: We are seeking candidates with either a strong computer science background with interests in physical oceanography and satellite altimetry, or a strong physical science background with interests in data science and cloud computing. The candidate should have a Ph.D. degree in one of these fields: Physical Oceanography Applied Math Computer Science Additionally, we expect candidates to be fluent in Python. Experience with geospatial analysis, AWS, and/or deep learning is a plus! The position is available immediately and will remain open until filled. Applicants may be subject to additional program requirements by NASA. Postdoctoral Scholar positions are awarded for a minimum of one-year period and may be renewed up to a maximum of three years. Candidates should submit their CV, representative publications, contact information for three references, and a cover letter stating their research accomplishments and interests. JPL is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.  We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is  truly  saying.  We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few. Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist.

She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results. Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues. We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=be3494d584aaa962&from=web&vjs=3,210,Research Engineer,Generally Intelligent,"San Francisco, CA","Summary We started Generally Intelligent because we believe that software with human-level intelligence will have a transformative impact on the world. We’re dedicated to ensuring that that impact is a positive one. We have enough funding to last for decades, and our backers include Y Combinator, researchers from OpenAI, Lightspeed, Threshold, and many others. This role is about creating software to support our scientific and engineering-driven approach to developing machines with human level intelligence. About the role You will run experiments in order to more deeply understand both the current solutions (e.g., what specific deep neural networks are learning) and the current problems (e.g., what about the training data makes it difficult to learn the patterns that seem so obvious to us). These experiments include changing the network architecture as well as the training data distribution (our data is mostly simulated). You will, in the course of running those experiments, spend most of your time creating reusable tools and systems required to actually run them and understand the results. Examples include visualizations for the data, changes to the simulator to create new data, and code for running large scale network architecture search across hundreds or thousands of containers. You will mostly pair program with other researchers and engineers. We find pair programming particularly useful because ML code needs a high level of correctness, and it’s helpful to have two minds working on a really hard problem. Plus it’s just more fun! You will participate in (our own unique version of) daily stand-ups, research planning, strategy discussions, paper clubs, learn-a-thons, and other activities designed to give us space to learn and plan and think. About you You are a software engineer who is passionate about understanding how the mind works. You want to build machines that truly understand the world in order to usher in a new era of abundance and flourishing for humanity. You do  not  need to have significant prior experience with machine learning (though it’s certainly a plus!) We’re very open to helping you learn to become a great machine learning engineer. We have done this for some current team members, and have a number of resources that make it very easy to get up-to-speed quickly. You  do  need to be a really good software engineer. Machine learning is 80%+ software engineering, so you should be very comfortable with Python. Other tools we use include PyTorch, docker, numpy, and wandb. About us We believe in working with the absolute best people in the world (which is why we pay top of market) We believe that there is something special about getting the most talented people together in one room, especially for research (which is why we’re fully in-person in SF) We believe that curiosity and personal growth are both extremely important (which is why you will have a $30K+ yearly budget for executive coaching, books, courses, conferences, etc) We believe that it is critical to not just attract great individuals, but build strong relationships between them (whichis why we have quarterly team off-sites, frequent team dinners, and other events) We believe in investing in resources so that you can work more effectively (which is why we have a $250K+ compute budget per person, dedicated contract engineers to support our researchers individually, why we’ve built internal tools to automate hyper-parameter optimization, etc) We believe in creating a culture of science and truth-seeking, where no idea is too crazy to consider and no ideas are considered holy (which is why we encourage questions in the middle of company-wide presentations and why we encourage the most junior members in a meeting to weigh in first) We also believe in creating a culture of psychological safety, where everyone feels able to voice their opinion without fear of judgment (which is why we have “Feelings Friday”, where we have space to share how we felt during the week, and why we have a culture manual with a bunch of small habits that help encourage safe, effective communication) We believe in having fun, and that being in a positive environment isn't just much more productive, it's just a better way to live (which is why we take Friday afternoons off together as a team, joke around, and join in each others’ hobbies, whether it’s D&D or hiking or meditation) We believe that creating software with human level intelligence comes with the responsibility to ensure that it benefits all of humanity, not just a select few (which is why we're creating a public benefit corporation, why we’re interested in safety research, and why we have internal working groups on safety). How to apply All submissions are reviewed by a person, so we encourage you to include a cover letter.
