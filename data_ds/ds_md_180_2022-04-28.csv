ATEC is the Army’s independent test and evaluation organization. We are a team of Civilian and Military personnel working together to provide America’s Military with the best equipment to win and return home safely. At ATEC, we have a saying: If a Soldier rides, wears, shoots, or deploys it, we test it. ATEC is at the forefront of testing and evaluating technologies of the future from autonomous aerial/ground vehicles to hypersonic weapons. Each day, top scientists and engineers test and evaluate cutting-edge equipment. Our workforce is highly technical and skilled, comprised of more than 8,500 military, civilian, and contract personnel. Engineers, scientists, technicians, researchers, and evaluators work with innovative, advanced technologies in 24 testing and research locations across the U.S. States and around the world. If you are a civilian who wants their work to make a difference, we look forward to hearing from you and receiving your application!   ATEC values diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, cultures and skills, which connects employees to organizations that are committed to building an inclusive work environment where they can contribute to their fullest potential. For more information on ATEC, salary, benefits, etc., see: https://www.atecciviliancareers.com.   PLACE OF WORK: This position is located within the US Army Test & Evaluation Command, Army Evaluation Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. 21005.   Relocation/Recruitment Incentives may be offered.   **This announcement will be used to fill many vacancies. Resumes/Transcripts will be pulled weekly. This vacancy announcement will remain open until all vacancies are filled but no later than 1 August 2022.   ABOUT THE POSITION: Serves as an Entry Level Employee/Recent Graduate within the U.S. Army Evaluation Center (AEC) learning the role of Evaluator, Analyst, or Test Manager. The program is a full-time position with work assignments, training, and self-development as you progress from entry level to a full performance position. Promotion Potential is GS-12/NH-03.   What Degrees or experience are you looking for?   We are looking for Recent Graduates who have Engineering, Math/Statistics, Operations Research, or any Physical Science degrees (Physics, Biology, Chemistry, etc.).   What type of work will I be doing as an Entry Level Employee/Recent Graduate with the organization?   Entry Level Employees/Recent Graduates in AEC do a variety of work. The first thing we would do upon your arrival is start formal training. Training would help provide more details about the work of our overall organization and how we fit into the larger Army Acquisition picture. We will then work to pair you with senior analysts, evaluators, or test managers to start shadowing, gradually handing you more responsibility and ownership of projects. Every piece of equipment that a Soldier touches has to pass through us for an evaluation. We evaluate everything! During your internship, you will participate in developmental assignments to help round out your experience. You will gain a broad experience to help form an understanding for what we do at AEC.   What does an Evaluator do?   When the Army wants to purchase a new tank (as an example), we work with the developer to come up with a plan to test it. Then, that system goes to an ATEC Test Center to be tested. We review and analyze the data to determine whether it meets the needs of the Army. We then write a report on how it performed so that the Army can decide whether to buy it. We oversee the whole test and evaluation process.   How long is the Entry Level Employee/Recent Graduate Program?   Our Entry Level Employee/Recent Graduate Program is typically three years of training with non-competitive placement to a permanent position. Full Performance is GS-12/NH-03.

Do you want to help lead data engineering and work closely with our software engineering team to structure, ingest, digest, and provide value-added data to internal and external customers? If so, we need you! We are looking for a smart data-minded engineer who can help us master our tech stack including Python, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Linux, and who can also help us ensure that we have a robust and secure platform. You will help build tools for internal developers to ingest data from a wide variety of data sources and help us create usable and re-usable tools to provide value-added data for customers. Simply (is this simple?), you will help us collect, sort, maintain, enhance, debug, evolve, solve, and create data that will make a difference. And, you can do all, or at least most, of your work from anywhere (remotely!). Apply today!             What you own (responsibilities): In this role, you own and are responsible for delivering key initiatives.             Develop, enhance, and maintain data pipeline internal architecture capable of ingesting structured and unstructured data using both batch & streaming methods.      Debug and improve SQL queries, fine-tune AWS RDS Postgres instances to enhance performance.

Success in developing automated data engineering tools.      Positive attitude with the ability to deal with ambiguity and dynamic growth environments; we are busy, growing quickly, and need team members who enjoy the challenges that come with growth including the ability to constructively prioritize and deliver on simultaneous needs.

What you can expect from us:             4 weeks of paid time off every year. Most of it doesn't roll over because we know we won't use it otherwise - and we know using it makes us better at our work and to each other.      Flexible working hours and schedules (some positions-like this one-will do some on-call weekend work on occasion, but we expect you to take time off during the week to make up for it)      Casual dress      A company-paid Google Pixel phone or monthly credit to apply for your tech needs (including upgrading your bandwidth)      12 paid holidays, including Juneteenth and the day after Thanksgiving      A monthly wellness stipend that you can use for things like a meditation app, standing desk, gym equipment, etc.      401(k) matching up to 4%      Up to $5,250/year for certification, continuing education, and tuition reimbursement.

However, most of our employees work remotely across the U.S. and we have some in Australia and some in Europe.             The physical requirements include prolonged periods sitting at a desk and working on a computer (though you can use the tech benefit to create whatever desk you’ll work best at).             We are an agile organization, and so the duties and description of this role (like every other at Apkudo) may change at any time as we adapt.             This position is exempt based on the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).                  About us:             We develop software and hardware platforms for the management of the connected device supply chain.
