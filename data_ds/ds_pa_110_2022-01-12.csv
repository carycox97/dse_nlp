We aspire to impact key industries that move people and goods, from ride hailing to deliveries.  Meet the team:  Our team delivers solutions to camera-based perception problems on the autonomous vehicle platform. These problems include object detection, scene segmentation, and various classification and regression problems. Perception is key to obstacle avoidance, prediction of actor behavior, and planning the motion of the vehicle itself. Our team takes algorithms that allow the vehicle to reason about the world around it from the lab to the road - everything from reading and understanding the research literature to deployment of production-grade vision systems on the vehicle. Understanding a large, messy, unstructured world in real-time is essential to the success of any autonomous robotics program, and one of the most challenging and fulfilling aspects of the work here at Argo.  We're looking for a talented senior-level machine learning engineer to join us. The ideal candidate should have experience building computer-vision-focused machine learning pipelines, controlling for all of precision, recall, computational performance, memory use, and multi-task tradeoffs. You should be comfortable reading papers, working on highly nontrivial problems without obvious solutions, and pushing the boundaries of the state of the art.  What you'll do:   Develop spatiotemporal machine learning models that capture behavior and state of scenes.  Read the literature, look at raw data, design state-of-the-art solutions, and productize them all the way from lab through to the test track, and ultimately bring them to public roads.  Act as a force multiplier across the team: use your experience to provide a voice of reason and knowledge, and identify opportunities for improvements that scale the engineering team further.  Build relationships with upstream and downstream partners and work cross-functionally to deliver high-impact features that improve our perception system.
