But all too often, it's stressful, especially in a competitive market or when you're buying and selling at the same time. So we're redesigning the homebuying experience. We're a fast-paced real estate startup that empowers agents to help homebuyers buy with cash. We buy homes on behalf of our partners' clients with our cash, then the client buys the home back from us.  Founder and CEO Tim Heyl, a 10-year industry veteran and owner of one of the fastest-growing agent teams in the country, started Homeward in 2018. In fact, he bought our first customer's home with his own life savings. Today we offer two services —  Buy with cash and Buy before you sell.  We've raised more than $160MM in equity capital from top-tier venture investors, including Norwest, Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Adams Street, Javelin, and LiveOak. Our leadership team includes experts from the real estate, mortgage, and technology industries.  About the opportunity  Homeward's Strategic Finance team serves as a combination of Financial Strategy and Analytics, and sits within the broader FP&A team.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.

About the role  The data and advertising group at Roku is looking for seasoned backend engineer with a background in machine learning to improve our ad experiences. Examples of such problems include improving ad-relevance, inferring demographics, yield optimization and many more. Employees in this role are expected to apply knowledge of experimental methodologies, statistics, optimization, probability theory and machine learning using code for tool building, statistical analysis and modeling, using both general purpose software and statistical languages.  What you'll be doing   ML-Infrastructure: Help build a first-class machine learning platform from the ground up which helps manage the entire model lifecycle: feature engineering, model training/evaluation, versioning, deployment/online serving and monitoring prediction quality.  Data Analysis/Feature Engineering: Apply your expertise to identify and calculate features that can be leveraged by multiple use cases as well as models.  Model training with batch and real-time prediction scenarios: Use machine learning and statistical modeling techniques such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Bayesian Analysis, Neural Networks and others to develop and evaluate algorithms to improve product/system performance, quality and accuracy.  Low level systems debugging, performance measurement & optimization on large production clusters.
