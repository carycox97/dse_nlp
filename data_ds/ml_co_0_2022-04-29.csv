Always Authentic : We keep it real. We believe in constructive honesty in all facets of our work.

Each of us are who we are regardless of the context. No playing politics and no BS. Just healthy, constructive, reality-based discourse.                      We Keep Our Promises : We make every effort to meet our commitments. If we’re unable to meet a commitment, we let others know right away. We consistently create methods to prioritize our work so we can meet our commitments. We commit ONLY when we intend to follow through, not as a tactic to move the discussion forward.                      Customer Obsessed : We start with customer needs and work backwards. We seek to collect customer data (when it is available) before making decisions. We regularly and proactively seek customer feedback on designs, offers and other work products.                      Measure and Adjust : We take every opportunity to define, publish and update metrics. We seek to measure and improve as we continue to invest in activities. We are willing to propose modifications when the data demands it.                      Continuously Innovate : We seek to understand before we act. We challenge prevailing assumptions and suggest better approaches. We embrace change. We often revisit previous trade-offs and apply new innovations.                      Make Decisions We Are Proud Of : We only make decisions we would be willing to share with our parents. We speak out when we see others making decisions that compromise our values.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=bef919c86fc07103&from=web&vjs=3,260,Program and Data Analyst,Lukos,"Colorado Springs, CO","Program and Data Analyst   Overall capability requirement:  The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) are separate commands. Both leverage the commander's singular vision and guidance; develop plans to meet challenges in the same strategic and operational environments; build complementary mission approaches; and share a common goal of defense of the United States and Canada.  Our competitors have analyzed our ability to operate overseas and have invested in capabilities such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, small unmanned aircraft systems, artificial intelligence, cyber capabilities, and delivery platforms to offset our strengths while exploiting our perceived weaknesses. These advancing capabilities embolden competitors and adversaries to challenge us at home, looking to threaten our people, our critical infrastructure and our power projection capabilities.  These challenges have generated a strong demand for not only changes in operations, but changes in the corresponding education and training programs supporting force employment, development, and design. You will join a team that performs analysis, assessment and integration in support of the Joint Training, Exercises, and Wargaming Directorate (N&NC/J7). We, collectively, provide the commands’ analytical methodology, to include Modeling & Simulation (M&S), necessary to develop and improve requirements-based training and readiness programs and ensure integration with the global DoD Joint Training community, interagency, and international partners. Our team provides the analytical capability to enhance command resources and readiness, augment (N&NC) training and exercise programs with correlated data resulting from in-depth analyses of real-world events, and inform future Joint Training Plans. We will focus on assessing the results and effects of government deployed training programs, events, and operations on mission readiness. Our team informs the commands’ return on investment data and supports targeted changes and enhancements to N&NC’s Training, Exercises, and Wargaming Programs.  Tasks to be performed:  You will work collaboratively with other team members to collect, assess, and compile previously conducted collective training events, Defense Readiness Reporting System reports, Joint Training Information Management System data, identified best practices, and applicable real world lessons learned. Areas for investigation include: modeling and simulation program, training readiness, N&NC Command Center Qualification Training, Joint Task Force Commander Training Course, Joint Force Headquarters/Joint Task Force Staff Training Course, Dual Status Commander Orientation Course, and Defense Support of Civil Authorities Executive Seminar, Arctic issues, Tri-Command Staff Talks, Public-Private-Partnership needs, international and interagency information sharing, and other programs related to developing an integrated layered defense.  You will apply standardized, rigorous, structured methodologies to create and validate a physical, mathematical, or otherwise logical representation of a system, entity, phenomenon, or process. You will incorporate the use of models (e.g. emulators, prototypes, simulations, simulators, and stimulators), either statically or dynamically, to develop data as a basis for making managerial, technical, strategic, or tactical decisions. You will conduct data analysis of a variety of systems (some cloud based) to help develop business decision support tools.  You will apply engineering and/or analytical disciplines required to analyze real-world operational lessons-learned data resulting in recommended changes to training venues to mitigate identified shortfalls. You will further assist the team in identifying, assessing, experimenting, and testing solutions resulting from the studies and analyses accomplished to generate improvements in J7 managed programs and business processes.
