https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=8f94e22426251dd1&from=web&vjs=3,340,Open Rank,Northeastern University,"Seattle, WA 98109","           Job no:  508129         Position Type:  Faculty Full-time (Non-Tenure Track)         Location:  Seattle Campus         Categories:  Khoury College of Computer Sciences                                          About Northeastern:                                 Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students, faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the confines of discipline, degree, and campus.           Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London; Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system. Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible, student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused research.           Northeastern’s comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and careers.                                            About the Opportunity:                                 The Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University invites applications for one or more positions at the rank of Assistant Teaching Professor/Associate Teaching Professor/Full Teaching Professor in the Professional Masters Programs and in the Align Program at Northeastern’s Seattle campus for AY2022-2023.                                            Responsibilities:                                 We are seeking highly-motivated individuals committed to excellence in teaching. Full-time appointments at all ranks are renewable, career-focused non-tenure-track positions with responsibilities in teaching and service. Opportunities for research and scholarship are possible with course releases to make time for scholarship. Primary responsibilities include teaching graduate courses at the MS-level and in the Align Program (see below for a description). We are searching across all areas of computer and data science. Classes primarily meet in the evening and are small, with 10-40 students in a section. Faculty are supported with TAs and graders. Successful candidates will create course content and materials, and collaborate closely with colleagues across all Northeastern University campuses. Student advising and service to the college and university are an integral component of the position. Northeastern University is a global university recognized by our renowned co-op program and our focus on experiential learning.           The ALIGN bridges are designed for students from a variety of undergraduate backgrounds who need supplemental technical courses in order to matriculate into the Master of Science programs. ALIGN consists of four courses emphasizing the foundational knowledge and technical skills required for success in the respective Master of Science programs.           The Challenge           Women represent more than 50% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but only 18% of CS graduates. Similarly, underrepresented minorities represent 25% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but just 10% of CS graduates. By closing these gaps, we will not only address a major economic issue, but also a profound issue of social equity and inclusion.           Our Solution           The Align MS in CS program differs from typical MS in CS programs in several key ways. It is:                   Designed for students who did not earn an undergraduate degree in CS                           Coupled with Northeastern’s famous co-op program to provide a paid 6-8 month work experience in one of the college’s network of 500+ corporate partners                           Taught at night year-round so students can keep up with other commitments and finish in 2.5 years                           Offered locally at tech hubs across the country: Boston, Charlotte, San Francisco (opened in January 2019), Seattle, and Silicon Valley.                   Our 5 year pilot to date has already demonstrated a graduation rate of 91%, with 100% employment and average salaries exceeding $100,000. Unlike code academies, our graduates are prepared for tech leadership career paths. Unlike undergraduate programs, the program takes only 2.5 years to complete. Most importantly, more than half of our graduates will be women and more than 25% will be underrepresented minorities. It is the ideal onramp for bringing a diversity of race, gender and thought to America’s tech workforce. Across all campuses we currently have 560 students in the Align MS in CS, with Seattle being the Align program’s original location. The Seattle campus is in the heart of South Lake Union, and in Computer Science we are growing rapidly, with currently 300 graduate students and projections to increase this significantly. Classes are held on campus in both day and evening timeslots, and we offer both the core Align program courses and a rich and growing collection of electives in software engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning.           Please learn more about the Align program at our website, https://align.khoury.northeastern.edu/                                            Qualifications:                                 A PhD in computer science or a related field is required by the appointment start date.                                                   Salary Grade:                                 FAC                                            Additional Information:                                 Please submit a cover letter of interest highlighting teaching accomplishments and relevant professional expertise, a curriculum vitae, a teaching statement, and the names and contact information of at least three references.

Our solutions enable our clients to improve their operations, reduce costs, increase sales, and build stronger customer relationships.     Our clients consistently recognize us for providing architecture and governance frameworks, implementing best practices to optimize reports, and building team capability through training programs. Our innovative tools and 33 certified visuals expand Power BI capabilities to save time for decision makers.     As a premier supplier to Microsoft for two decades, our clients benefit from our extensive insights on the platform and engineering practices. As a Microsoft Partner with 10 Gold competencies, our clients improve their implementations with our breadth and depth of expertise.     With globally integrated teams in Redmond, Washington, and Mumbai and Hyderabad, India, we deliver solutions with increased velocity and tech intensity.     Inc. magazine has recognized us for sustained growth by listing us on the Inc. 5000 list ten times – a rare honor.        Engineering culture     We foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude. All our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience growing a company and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of the larger industry players. As a part of the company’s globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles.     Our developers routinely work on challenging technical problems that utilize the latest technologies for fast-paced software delivery.        Examples of some of our projects:          We built a supervised machine learning model that forecasts the impact of retail sales on our client’s overall revenue. We collected data from existing customer relationship management (CRM) and sales systems. We created a forecasting model in Azure Databricks using existing and custom linear regression to process the collected data. To reduce forecast runtime and achieve near real-time analysis, we modified the existing R libraries to SparkR. The improved insight helped our client proactively focus on retailers with the highest sales impact.      We built a check-in app for one of our client’s most attended event. A multinational technology company organizes an annual multi-event internal expo attended by thousands of their employees. The manual process of tracking attendance, sending acknowledgments, and receiving feedback was time consuming. To automate the process, we built a check-in app that uses mobile devices’ camera to capture the identification badge of each participant. The captured images are stored in an Azure Blob. An Azure Logic App reads the image content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API to update attendance records. After the event, notifications are sent to attendees via Microsoft Teams to complete a feedback survey using a Microsoft Power Automate Bot. The Feedback App reports the survey responses to determine the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of the event.      For another client with high volume data, we developed and implemented a hybrid data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks to reduce data refresh time from 3 hours to less than 30 minutes. We sourced data from the Azure Event Hub, where refreshes originate. Refreshes are captured through stream analytics and the updated data is pushed to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The data is processed in ADLS, then pushed to Power BI for reporting.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=31bc2d6b1710bbb3&from=web&vjs=3,320,"Lead Machine Learning Engineer, Fraud Risk",Block,"Seattle, WA","    Company Description    Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.           Job Description    The Fraud Machine Learning & Decision Science (MLDS) team within Square Risk is looking for a Machine Learning Tech Lead. This senior role will be responsible for driving machine learning technology strategy for Fraud at Square. This is a very visible role and touches on developing event-driven intelligent software across all money movement (and other events) across the entire Square seller ecosystem of products.    This touches on actively maximizing the trade-off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning-driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning/representation learning, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller-facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.    This role will closely collaborate with product managers across the fraud vertical, Risk leaders, and other machine learning teams within the Risk Engineering and Machine Learning & Decision Science organization as well as ML teams across Square and Block. This also includes collaboration with various ML platform teams both within Risk across Block.     You Will         Drive technical ML strategy across the Fraud vertical within Square Risk      Collaborate with and mentor other machine learning engineers in the team      Build machine learning/deep learning models that detect risk (e.g., fraud) activity in real-time across the Square seller ecosystem consisting of payments, banking, and other commerce enablement-related products.      Balance deeply technical concepts with creative “forward-thinking” growth principles to balance the tradeoff between risk and growth by looking holistically across the Square ecosystem.      Collaborate with business leaders, subject matter experts, and decision-makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models              Qualifications    You Have         An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics or a related technical field.      PhD with 4+ years (or Master 6+ years) industry working experience on applied Machine learning or Deep learning in a production environment with a history of delivering value to customers and the business.      A strong track record of performing modern machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, etc.) within machine learning software development lifecycle paradigms.      Expert-level knowledge of modern techniques in machine learning and deep learning, e.g., transformer network architectures, with an orientation to maximizing such algorithms in a large-scale production setting. The reinforcement learning experience is a plus for developing optimal control policies      Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation.      Machine learning strategic sequencing of methodological and software improvements to work back from maximizing core metrics associated with optimizing the business.      The ability to clearly communicate (verbal and written) complex results to technical and non-technical audiences and stakeholders (PMs, Operations, Engineers).

After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.           Job Description    The Payment Platform is an open, global financial services platform for developers who serve sellers. It provides the necessary components to manage identity, process payments across multiple channels, hold and transfer funds, and provide accounting, reconciliation, and reporting in a secure and compliant way.        We process billions of dollars worth of transactions every year. At that scale, even small optimizations can lead to a major impact. As a Machine Learning Engineer on Payment Platform, you will partner with software engineers, product managers, and data scientists to seamlessly integrate machine learning into our payment processing. Current work includes building models to optimize pricing, improve payment routing, reduce decline rates, and predict transaction costs.

Then this is the job for you!         At Automated Profitability Management (APM), our vision is to automate and improve Amazon Profitability through the innovative application of Machine Learning and Software Engineering. Traditionally, this involved an Amazon business person picking up the phone, calling up Selling Partners to discuss and improve the terms of doing business with Amazon. These terms include: what is the price Amazon pays for products it buys? How do we handle the cost of bringing in the product / cover any damage to the products? Can we get funding for initiatives like promotions and merchandising on our website? Do we have alternative sourcing channels (e.g. two or more Selling Partners offering the same product) so we can negotiate harder? Each of these negotiation decisions has a direct impact on Amazon’s profitability.         Now imagine doing this across tens of thousands of Selling Partners and tens of millions of products, across tens of different countries worldwide, and at a double-digit growth rate every year. Clearly it is not a problem we can rely on humans to scale. We need machines to make these high judgement decisions. How do we do that? The good thing is we have data. Tons of them – historical contracts, product costs and historical funding, sales performance etc. We leverage this advantage to solve the problem using algorithms, machine learning and data-driven approaches. We are turning the art of Retail profitability management into a science. At Automated Profitability Systems, we are developing systems that will use technology to disrupt and fundamentally change the way e-commerce costs and Selling Partner terms are managed.
