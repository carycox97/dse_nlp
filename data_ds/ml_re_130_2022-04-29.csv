https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=b4c3724a259fc553&from=web&vjs=3,180,Medical AI & Informatics (remote),Confidential,Remote,"  TL;DR :  Seeking an experienced clinical professional to join a fast-growing startup building an AI medical scribe to drastically cut down the time that clinicians have to spend on EMR documentation so that they can focus on what they do best: caring for patients.   Who we are    We are a stealth-stage startup building an AI platform to drastically cut down the time that clinicians have to spend on EMR documentation and admin so that they can focus on what they do best: caring for patients. We are led by seasoned founders with direct experience building machine learning products in healthcare and deep connections to customers and strategic channel partners. After several watershed R&D breakthroughs, the team attracted significant funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Jeff Dean, Richard Socher, Pieter Abbeel, Anne Wojcicki, and healthcare industry veterans.   Role overview    Your mission is to guide the development of an artificial intelligence algorithm that is able to create SOAP notes for clinicians within seconds after patient encounters that are easy to review and easy to edit.   You’ll be responsible for designing and executing strategies to teach our machine how to understand medical conversations and auto-generate documentation. The ideal candidate is a creative problem solver armed with a background in primary / urgent care (either through experience as a scribe or as a former healthcare provider). No prior experience in ML or AI is necessary.   Key Responsibilities:       Design strategies to identify the right data for labeling so that we can efficiently teach our machine the nuances of key medical concepts    Test and monitor machine learning models, execute root cause analysis of failure modes, and design interventions to systematically improve model performance     Skills, Knowledge, and Expertise:       Experienced medical professional with 2+ years of documentation experience (scribing or practicing) in urgent care, primary care, family medicine, or internal medicine (required)    Strong team player who is unafraid of owning and delivering on outcomes (required)    Experience with algorithmic thinking — writing computer programs, configuring software systems, setting up templates in your electronic medical record, etc. (nice-to-have)     This role is right for you if:       You want to leverage your clinical expertise in urgent/primary care to help build technology-driven solutions.    You want to scale your impact and drastically improve the efficiency, safety, and satisfaction of hundreds of thousands of healthcare providers.    You enjoy working in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment that fosters innovation and continuous improvement (without the bureaucracy of traditional healthcare organizations).    You're a creative problem solver capable of thinking in first-principles (resist ""this is how it’s always been done"" thinking).    You're a clear thinker and clear communicator (written and verbal) even on complex and ambiguous issues (especially important in a remote-work environment).    You're a driven ""extreme owner"" who derives joy from achieving goals and consistently delivering excellence.    You have high EQ and can regulate the emotions of yourself and your team, even under pressure.    You want to live and breathe a culture that prioritizes mission over self-interested agendas    You value ego-free decision-making (i.e. the best ideas rather than the loudest voices).    You treat others the way you'd like to be treated.     Why you might not be excited about us       We're small (~20 people in the company now), so if you like more established companies, it's not (yet) the right time. You'll help build our company's culture.    Since we're an early stage startup, projects and priorities may shift.    Our customers love us, and there's a lot we can improve. It's a great place to be, but means there are some parts of our product and tooling that will naturally evolve in the coming months.    Since you'll have a lot of responsibility and creativity over projects, they may not be defined perfectly initially. You'll be expected to bring your own experience and perspective to help us do the right things, and raise flags if you think we should do things differently.     Compensation and time       This is a full-time salaried, remote position ($60K) and a growth path with opportunity for equity    May require some evening and weekend availability to liaise with internationally-based team members     Benefits       Work remotely from anywhere.    We’re proud to offer unparalleled training & development opportunities across clinical, product/design, and engineering disciplines.    We provide full medical, vision, and dental coverage, 401K, and other benefits.    You’ll be part of a diverse and highly mission-oriented team     Job Type: Full-time   Pay: $60,000.00 per year   Benefits:      401(k)    Dental insurance    Flexible schedule    Health insurance     Schedule:      8 hour shift    Day shift    Monday to Friday    Weekend availability     COVID-19 considerations: We are a remote company and our team is able to work from the safety and comfort of their own homes.   Application Question(s):      Please indicate your prior scribing / practice experience in urgent care, primary care, family medicine, or internal medicine. (2+ years experience required)    This is a full-time position at a startup where the team is ambitious, outcome-oriented, and works hard to deliver on a weekly basis. Is that something you can commit to?    Do you have any experience with computer programming, configuring software systems, or system design of any kind?
