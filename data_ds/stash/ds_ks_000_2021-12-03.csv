We are looking for a researcher whose interests are in mixed effect modeling in pharmacology/pharmacokinetic data and a researcher with a methodological and application focus. The postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to model comparative pharmacokinetic data in the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank (FARAD) and relevant physiological and pathophysiology data in an intellectually vibrant environment with ample mentorship. The appointment is performed at both NCSU in Raleigh and K-State Olathe in Olathe, KS; therefore, the successful applicant is expected to rotate between both research labs during the 2-3 year period. The FARAD project has been fortunate to be funded by the USDA for the last 38 years. The FARAD researchers are respected Global leaders in developing and applying pharmacometrics approaches in understanding and helping alleviate harmful drug and chemical residues from appearing in our nation's food supply. We are looking for an independent researcher who should possess experience with applications in methodological and/or applied mixed-effects modeling, Bayesian modeling, and Monte-Carlo Simulation techniques. Our research group across both Universities provides a stimulating modeling environment by encouraging active collaborations with scientists trained in biostatistics, computational biology, bioinformatics, and pharmacology/toxicology. The primary aim of this joint research collaboration between NCSU and K-State is to better understand the many factors that influence the pharmacometrics of drugs and environmental contaminants across multiple species, and especially food animal species, as these estimates can significantly impact the occurrence of drug residues in our nation's food and ultimately of food safety importance. The postdoctoral fellow may be involved in the evaluation of the utility of model solutions and seek the determination of pharmacometric models to leverage information with strong feedback characteristics. The developed pharmacometric models may be used to describe and predict the impact of the following on drug residues in food animals: animal/patient demographics, food animal production systems, patho-physiological processes relating to disease state and/or disease progression in animals, and pattern and magnitude of exposure to a given pharmacologic or environmental agent. This work could also include the potential use of models to guide experimental/clinical trial design and for hypothesis testing, as both research labs are part of the animal and analytical chemistry support teams. The proposed research will provide a key foundation for our future studies in order to achieve our long-term goal which is to contribute to the development of a web-based mixed effect model interfaces for more drugs in multiple food animal species (e.g., swine, cattle, poultry, goats, or sheep) for real-time drug and chemical residue avoidance guidance. This is envisioned as a multipurpose platform that will integrate and analyze disparate sources of safe withdrawal intervals of drugs and chemicals in food-producing animals for integration into a single platform for the FARAD (www.FARAD.org).  Responsibilities include: Model comparative pharmacokinetic data in FARAD and relevant physiological and pathophysiology data in an intellectually vibrant environment with ample mentorship. The appointment is performed at both NCSU in Raleigh and K-State Olathe in Olathe, KS; therefore, the incumbent is expected to rotate between both research labs during the 2-3 year period.
