For more details, read on!  About the Company:  We all waste a staggering amount of time (~33%) because we have no idea where we are spending it. Worse yet, we continue to operate in a factory model that simply does not apply to creative work. Our big bet is that by understanding time, we'll be able to move away from it as a unit of value. In the future knowledge economy (lawyers, accountants, engineers), contributions will be assessed on value added, not the underlying time spent adding it.  Ambitious mission to say the least, so where are we starting? We have created a new market category called  Time Automation  that automates the timekeeping process for professionals and allows us to collect time data at scale. Before TBP, professionals had to manually record every six minutes of their day into antiquated timekeeping software. Not anymore.  We are a Series B company (>$55M in venture capital from Tier 1 funds) that has assembled some of the best builders, designers, and product minds in tech—and we all have one thing in common: we are deeply motivated by our mission  to return time .  We need to find like-minded colleagues who want to join us on our journey and are willing to spend their time solving time. It will be a long road but if we're even half right, we'll change the way work is measured and performed forever.  About the Role:  Come lead our Product Automation Strategy and use of ML to return human time as our Director of Engineering for Machine Learning. This role is responsible for creating a system that fundamentally understands how people work, then applying this the problem we are solving today of shortening the time users spend converting work activities into timesheets to deliver on our promise to help timekeepers bill more time,  in   less time.  While we build out our burgeoning ML group, this role requires you to develop short and mid term strategy, recruiting of a world class engineering team, and relentless product execution by bringing real-world use of machine learning and coupling it in a consumer-grade software experience for enterprise customers.  As the first leadership hire dedicated to this core company function, you will set the culture and approach — boldly differentiating us from our competition and stirring the imagination of the many customers we serve and will serve tomorrow on the possibilities of Time Automation for their industries (yes, beyond legal).  You will be responsible for a full stack team that will include the data storage and processing infrastructure, the cleansing and analysis of the data, model creation and delivery, integration of those models into backend services and the presentation layer, and regular feedback telemetry monitoring for in-field performance. You will be broadly empowered to make both the technology selections and engineering process decisions to optimally deliver.  Core Duties:  Build, own, and drive our Automation strategy and technology, and in particular our Machine Learning and other Predictive Services work to help minimize time and effort for timesheet creation.  Collaborate with the Design team to create a design language that helps our users understand how TBP works for them, demystifying the automation.  Lead our Engineering efforts to develop a world class infrastructure and pipeline for data, machine learning, and model management that allows us to improve the product at blistering speed (model creation, management, and deployment).  Deliver regular releases of models and service releases to improve the products automation capabilities.  Collaborate with Sales, Product Marketing, and Customer Success so they effectively speak to our automation capabilities for their stakeholders, driving product sales and adoption.  Maintain a strong understanding of customer behavior, the competitive landscape, and industry trends and meet with our stakeholders regularly.

Why? Because our pets make us better humans, and we owe them the best possible care. As the premier partner to a new generation of pet parents, we use our data, products, and services to help people be the best pet parents they can be. And we unite changemakers in pet care to break down barriers, open new doors, share insights, and advance our collective knowledge. All so we can reimagine the pet parenting experience, up people's confidence, and help the world find better ways to care.  Kinship is a coalition that includes:   Adopt-a-Pet, the destination for finding homes for homeless pets; we help animal shelters, humane societies, SPCAs, pet rescue groups, and pet adoption agencies connect their homeless pets to millions of adopters a month  Our world-leading Wisdom Panel™ genetic health screening and DNA testing for dogs  The award-winning Whistle™ GPS dog tracker and health monitor  Pet Insight Project, our ground-breaking science team that uses AI to turn billions of data points into actionable insights  VETINSIGHT™ which gives modern pet parents the veterinary and wellness guidance needed to make smarter, more informed health decision for their pets.

And, as a part of Mars Petcare, they work to create a better world for pets. Learn more at www.kinship.co. OUR  TEAM  Pet Insight is a team of data scientists and engineers, life scientist and veterinarians, and other technologists that have partnered with Whistle Labs - the premier pet care IoT technology, Banfield Pet Hospital - the largest general veterinary practice in the United States, and pet owners - citizen scientists, to conduct the largest population health study in pet care.  The Pet Insight Project has been built fresh, from the ground up, with modern best-in-class technologies. In a short time, our small team (with the support of the larger Kinship and Whistle teams) has created a brand-new system, built around our unique machine learning algorithms that have been trained and validated on an unmatched volume of real-world data. While there's plenty of work left to be done, we are building out and scaling up, and our system is already helping us to understand the life of a pet on a second-by-second basis, in a level of detail never explored before. We're looking for an expert in creating and training data-driven models to lead the extension of our current technologies and develop new and innovative ways that ML can help improve the lives of pets. As part of our small team of like-minded data scientists, you'll also help deploy these models to production to help process time-series sensor data, classify images, label sounds, or even help understand videos depending on the specific use case.  HOW YOU'LL HELP EVERYONE PET PARENT LIKE A PRO  The work you'll do here is critically important because ""pets can't talk"", they can't tell you when they're not feeling well or need something. The Pet Insight team ""gives pets a voice"" and empower pet parents to improve the quality of life for the pets they love so much.  Pet Insight is using artificial intelligence to develop advanced deep learning models (see FilterNet https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/9/2498) to uncover important links between pet behaviors, activity, and health.  This understanding is critical to telling a more complete ""health story"" and empowering pet owners to better care for the animals they love. Pet Insight's algorithms are integrated as key product features in Kinship's services to enable a very personalized experience for the pet owner, creating earlier awareness around pet needs, stimulating better decision-making, and accelerating the growth of core pet care products.  It also has the power to transform conventional veterinary medicine, by moving the profession beyond generally accepted practice to a whole new level of personalized care driven by objective, evidence-based, precision-medicine.  Your job will be to leverage our one-of-a-kind dataset to help shape and build applications that use machine learning models to help improve the lives of pets by:   Conducting experiments to investigate the feasibility of new product features for improving pet health and happiness using machine learning, retrospective analyses, behavioral data, and medical records.  Leading development and statistical design of new product features, from early exploration through commercial deployment.  Designing user surveys, collecting survey data, and analyzing survey responses to better understand and improve our statistical models.  Developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models that leverage our unique combination of behavior data and medical record data to detect and alert owners to potential health problems using changes in the pets' behaviors.  Managing and collaborating with data science contractors.  Performing statistical analysis on the outputs of machine learning models to help update, re-train, and re-deploy new ML models to improve the overall data processing pipeline.  Improve and extend machine learning models used to predict a dog's behavior from sensor-based time-series data.

Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act. Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface. We’re looking for a thoughtful, data-savvy, and product-focused designer to join our growing team. In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to drive the visual and interaction identity of Sisu, as well as design and launch a wide range of product experiences from concept to implementation.

What you'll accomplish: Refine and implement Sisu’s look and feel in the product Design and ship business-critical, user-centric, data-oriented product experiences Create storyboards, wireframes, and prototypes to communicate your ideas to the team Work cross-functionally with product, engineering, and sales to identify and prioritize customer needs Elevate design thinking and culture at Sisu, as part of our small, but growing design team  What you'll need to be successful: A strong sense of design fundamentals, including iconography, typography, color, and data visualization Creativity, persistence, and inquisitiveness about analytics, BI, and enterprise data, and the desire to help businesses solve problems in new ways A track record of designing and building rich, accessible desktop experiences Ability to design and iterate quickly and efficiently in a dynamic setting Comfort tackling ambiguous problem spaces and ability to bring clarity through problem definition, scoping, and prioritization for design Prior experience conducting customer research of any type and ability to synthesize qualitative feedback with data to guide design decisions Experience teaming up with engineers and designers to build and ship products Familiarity with design tools, such as Figma, Sketch, and Principle  Nice to have: Prior experience building enterprise or data-oriented products Prior experience with data visualization  For a product designer,  there’s no better environment to advance your career, develop your skills, and make an impact along the way. As you mature in this role, you’ll have the chance to work with global leaders, learn from industry mavericks, and help build an amazing, eclectic, and supportive organization.

We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few. Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants. This role is an  in-house mathematician  role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term. The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results. Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues. We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works. Requirements:  Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis. Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths. Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.

Pertussis following infection or vaccination. Qualified applicants will have the opportunity to collaborate with our interdisciplinary team of experimental and computational scientists working towards understanding, preventing, and curing infectious diseases. We are looking to fill either a postdoctoral position or a senior bioinformatician position with experience in the analysis of sequencing data and immunology.  Projects: Areas of research may include the following:   TB: Around 2 billion individuals are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Despite the relative low lifetime risk of latently infected individuals developing the active disease, it has been estimated that 80% of new cases of TB are due to reactivation of latent disease. In hoping to meet the World Health Organizations goals of TB eradication, our aim is to develop an efficient diagnostic test that can predict which individuals are likely to progress to active TB.  Pertussis: In the mid-1990s, concerns over vaccine-related side effects prompted the replacement of the whole-cell Pertussis (wP) vaccine in favor of a safer acellular Pertussis (aP) vaccine. Recently, there has been a worldwide reemergence of Pertussis (whooping cough) despite widespread vaccination. Our approach is to compare individuals born before 1995 and vaccinated in infancy with wP, with individuals born in 1996 or later and vaccinated with aP in infancy. We hope to identify the cascade of immune events following Pertussis booster vaccination, and to identify correlates of long-lasting vaccine-induced immunity.   Qualifications & Requirements:  (Note that there is also the possibility to create custom positions for applicants that do not match the specifics here but have outstanding skills in two or more of the areas below).  The ideal candidate will have extensive skills/knowledge in at least 2 of the following areas  1. Experimental data analysis—RNA-Seq, flow/mass cytometry, single cell analysis 2. Immunology—adaptive immunity and epitope recognition 3. Data analysis techniques—statistics, data visualization, machine learning 4. Software development—programming in Python preferred, or proficiency in other programming languages (Unix Shell, version control) 5. Knowledge representation—database systems, RDF/OWL, OBO ontologies  Have the ability to independently drive projects  Candidates must either hold a PhD or MD degree, OR must have gathered expert level skills through multi-year hands-on work in the area.   To Apply:  Please submit a CV & Cover Letter and indicate one or more potential matches to the specific projects from above. Responsibilities and pay will depend on the candidate’s skills/qualifications. Applications without a cover letter will NOT be reviewed. Appointment:  Appointment term is typically 2-5 years, but can be longer for senior bioinformatics candidates. Start Date:  Start date is flexible until positions are filled.

Ionosphere demonstrates local response to a geomagnetic storm superimposed on daily, seasonal and solar cycle dependent variabilities. These different phenomena make characterization of regional ionospheric dynamics a complex problem. New observational capabilities and sophisticated data analysis tools provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of ionosphere dynamics during storms as compared to quiet times. Specifically, the Total Electron Content (TEC) of the ionosphere is readily available from GPS measurements. Analysis of TEC dynamics over ground-based GPS sites using network analysis is of major interest. Characterizing network topology, connections between TEC measurements at different locations, directionality of the network can lead to better understanding of ionospheric dynamics and advances in space weather forecasting. We seek highly motivated candidates to participate in research on ionospheric dynamics and data analysis. We are particularly interested in candidates who will analyze satellite and ground-based observations to improve our understanding of space weather. Knowledge of basic signal processing techniques and system science approaches are encouraged.  References:  1. Verkhoglyadova, O. P., Komjathy, A., Mannucci, A.
