It is an ambitious  vision  that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of  machine   learning  and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat. The AIML Sequence  Learning  Team applies  machine   learning  and AI methods to DNA and RNA sequence  data  from large-scale human genetic, functional  genomic  and single  cell  experiments. DNA sequence variations are linked to disease via changes in the nature and abundance of protein and RNA gene products. The Sequence  Learning  group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other  data  sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone. This is an exciting methodological advance at the intersection of  NLP  inspired language models applied to biological  data .
