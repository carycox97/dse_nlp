A nonprofit organization operating in 29 countries, we work with enterprising men and women in the developing world to build competitive farms, businesses and industries. By linking people to information, capital and markets, we have helped millions to create lasting prosperity for their families and communities. Practice Overview TechnoServe’s Impact team is a dynamic and growing unit of global experts in monitoring and evaluation and business insights data, with the mandate of providing highest quality evidence to support decision-making in our projects around the world. We support the use of logical frameworks, timely data reporting, and rapid feedback loops to guide program design and adaptive management. Our work is matrixed with every other business unit in the organization, and we actively coordinate with teams across the office and around the world to support data flow and data use. Job Summary The Data Science Manager supports the Impact Team and other key functional units with first class data management, data analysis, and data visualizations to foster insights about our work. TechnoServe maintains 2 data reporting systems across our 29 country offices: Corporate Measurement for vetting, aggregating, and publishing our impact externally, and Progress Status Reports for internally monitoring the status of projects. The Data Science Manager will play a leading role in backstopping and coordinating these two systems. This will require a deep understanding of data structure, data processing, and software functions to support data flow and interoperability between systems. Additionally, the Data Science Manager will help maintain and develop data systems that respond to the needs of specific projects and the organization as a whole - this will require significant listening, collaboration, and resourcefulness. The Data Science Manager will play a leading role in efforts to identify best practices in data management and lead workstreams related to standardizing database designs. The goal of this position is to bring greater efficiency and ease of data use to the organization, fostering greater engagement with the evidence guiding our impact.

The Data Science Manager will advise teams on the appropriate use of technology, assist teams in setting up their systems, and consolidate knowledge and best practice for MEL technology. Back-end support to existing technology and data gathering systems (25%): TechnoServe maintains two systems through which projects report the results that the Data Science Manager will oversee. The project status report (PSR) is a quarterly routine through which projects share their progress on field activities. The PSR is based in google sheets and requires some knowledge of scripts to maintain. Corporate Measurement (CM) is an annual routine through which TechnoServe reviews and aggregates impact data from across the portfolio. The Data Science Manager will help manage the reporting process, in part by creating tools and tracking systems. This process is currently managed through SalesForce and requires creating data flows between SalesForce and Google Sheets. The Data Science Manager will be responsible for vendor management including billing, relationship management, and developing systems to ensure teams are properly using the technology. The Data Science Manager will be cross trained in some of the technology processes used by the Finance, Information, and Technology (FIT) team (MS SQL and SSIS integrations) in order to serve as a backup to this in rare instances. Developing systems (25% LOE): The Data Science Manager will be involved in efforts to overhaul and consolidate several existing software platforms such as the ones used for Corporate Measurement, the Project Status Report, and the Program Quality Survey. This may include the design process, directly creating the new platform, or supervising consultants.The Data Science Manager  may  be asked to modify existing SalesForce-based systems used by our business development team and other teams (requiring some knowledge of Javascript or APEX).

It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.  We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.
