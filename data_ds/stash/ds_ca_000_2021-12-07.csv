Born and raised in sunny San Diego, we are a well-funded, high-growth SaaS Martech company that's on a mission to disrupt today’s fastest growing industry: eCommerce! By unifying a digital retailer’s marketing stack, we enable them to deliver meaningful interactions that create loyal lifetime customers! We’ve seen a lot of growth since we established in 2017 and the funny part is that we actually never intended to become a company! Back in 2013, our 3 co-founders designed Sendlane to address needs within their own businesses. Now, we service over 1,700 businesses across the world and that’s been solely possible because we are constantly looking to out-do ourselves and evolve. Listen, we get it. Job hunting is 100% THE worst. So, we're happy to tell you the search is over! You did it! You finally found the company of your dreams. Go ahead and give your boss the middle finger, flip your desk, knock over your cubicle and march your happy self on over to Sendlane HQ! Just kidding...we have to invite you. Please don't just show up. Our team’s dedication to making Sendlane what it is today is humbling which is why we’re looking for that next “special someone” to help take us to the next level. That’s where you come in! Yes, you, buckaroo. We’re actively looking for TWO Sr. Data Engineers! (A first for our company) Here’s the deal. We consider ourselves a fairly data-driven company. In fact, it’s what we pride ourselves on. Especially as we embark on the next 18 months of building out our platform, growing our client base, and enhancing our functionality, we have to get even better about leveraging the data before us. We want to be able to make better and more educated predictions, using analyses and insights to catapult us forward. There’s just one little, teeny, tiny problem: We’re at a complete loss on how to make this happen at the scale we need. No, seriously, it’s making our eyes cross, please help. Joining an Engineering team of 17 folks, you’d be the first of your kind for our organization which is excellent news if your goal is to come in and build. You’ll not only be building out systems to help us better analyze our data but you’ll be building out what this role should truly look like at Sendlane! This is a killer opportunity for someone who is looking to make a big impact and grow quickly! But before we talk anymore about the role itself, let’s talk about you! You’re a proactive and analytical problem-solver who is conventional in approach, albeit, inquisitive and curious. Considering that your days will likely be full of debugging and examining data quality (amongst other things, of course), you’re definitely detail-oriented with critical reasoning that helps you objectively analyze data and uncover hidden insights or assess data credibility! Driven by your creativity and inventive solutions, you’re able to frame problems in a different angle which would be otherwise unexplored, developing visualizations that efficiently deliver such insights. Most important of all (outside of being an autonomous, lean, mean building machine) is that you’re a superb communicator/translator. Being able to communicate in a language that everyone can understand as it relates to all the data you’re working with is imperative. Considering that your communication about analysis impacts data driven solutions, that makes sense, right? RIGHT! If this all sounds like you, and we haven’t lost you yet, let’s get back to talking about this position! First, we have some qualifying questions for you to answer… Are you a “data person”, yes or no? Do you look for connections using data, yes or no? Do you enjoy creating new data sources, maintaining them and growing them over time, yes or no? Do you love to help others make more educated decisions based on your ability to analyze data, yes or no? Have you built tools to leverage data (admins/dashboards), yes or no? These questions should give you a pretty good understanding of what our expectations would be of the person filling this role. Above all else, we need someone who knows how to build out data systems. Having the wherewithal to pick the tools, design the infrastructure and organize all the data sets we make available, you’ll leverage all this to build out dashboards and business reports that then get communicated back to leadership and other teams, as needed (by you). Again, the ability to translate data analyses into actionable business insights and communicate them to various stakeholders is the most significant trait of the person taking this bull by the horns! Because you’re a data person, we’re assuming that there is never actually enough data for you. We’d love to write paragraphs more about all that this position will involve but bullet points might be best. That said, here’s the bulleted-skinny on what you could expect in this role, what’s required and what would be “nice to have”... Here’s what your day-to-day will look like… Work very closely with the CTO who also has a data engineering background Work with various internal resources to structure valuable data, augment it and store it Gather data from other systems and 3rd parties as needed to add additional datasets and value Develop systems to query this data, optimize it and generate reporting from it Assist teams in establishing data driven procedures and make it easy for them to see data needed for their daily operations and decision making Generate core metrics used to evaluate customers and provide visibility to our Compliance and Customer Success teams Monitor and create various KPIs for the company and internal teams using the data you procure on their behalf Here’s what you have to know... Python AWS (boto apis, awscli, console) Big Data tools (Athena/Presto, Redshift, Map-Reduce) File storage formats (Avro, Parquet, CSV, TSV) and compression (Snappy, GZIP, etc) High level of expertise in complex SQL Familiarity with AWS cost controls and cost optimization Ability to build dashboards and ad-hoc query tools for operations teams Finally, here are our “nice to haves” on what you’re familiar with... Looker, R, Google Studio or equivalent Django/Flask PHP/Laravel Vue.js Sound good so far? Excellent. That said, let’s talk about what’s in it for you! We strive to ensure that our employees have the best experience possible (while still remembering that you are here to do a job). COVID put a major damper on the fun we offer in-office but we’ve adjusted pretty well! Here’s our benefits package: Work in a hybrid environment - No pressure to return to office (ever!) but it’s open for your use, if you’d like! Health/Dental/Vision - 70% to 100% paid for by us (depends on the plan you pick). Parental Leave - New parent? Congrats! Count on 6 weeks of leave, separate from our PTO policy! 401k - Your future self will thank your current self for the investment (And we match up to 4%) Flexible PTO - Take what you need when you need it. We pay you to GO AWAY - $1000 bonus for taking time off! Equity - If you’re helping us build, we want you to have a piece! Equipment for your home office (including a MacBook and giant monitor) Monthly remote team building and consistent team engagement (we won’t force you to do Yoga with us but we will challenge you to do your best impression of the Spice Girls for $100) The pandemic is constantly evolving and now we’re all frantically looking for a therapist to help us work through our newfound agoraphobia. After some conversation and a team vote, we unanimously agreed that remaining a hybrid team is the bees knees. That said, if you want to work remotely for the rest of time...great! But, if you prefer some human interaction and you’re local to San Diego (or visiting) our HQ is open for use at your discretion! Currently sitting at a whopping 12,000 square feet of open floor plan, you can count on ping pong tables, shuffleboard, a fully stocked break room, a really cool coffee maker, a really really cool sparkling water dispenser, catered lunches daily, beer+wine (after 4 o’clock), standing desks, ergonomic chairs with 18 adjustment points and actually socializing in person with people - do you remember what that’s like? Neither do we. Job Type: Full-time Pay: $120,000.00 - $160,000.00 per year",,

As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to re-invent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.  To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.  Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.  The Role  We aim to establish the Span panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. Analytics and ML are essential tools to develop features for the smart, green, energy-efficient home of the future.
