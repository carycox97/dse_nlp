When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.  Job Description Content is king — Square merchants succeed when their content conveys the story and value of their products effectively. Yet the average merchant is not an expert in product photography, copywriting, SEO, or design. Furthermore, the average merchant has many existing sources of content available to them, but digitizing them to put them on an online store requires tedious manual effort. These factors hinder merchants from putting their best foot forward and starting selling online quickly. The Square Ecommerce ML team focuses on removing these frictions by using ML to help merchants import, manage, and improve their content. We have successful applications for some of these problems, but we're still discovering the best ways to accomplish this and the best applications for ML in this context. We're looking for a creative ML Engineer that is interested in building merchant-facing products, that is excited about finding novel ways of applying existing ML techniques to create exciting new products, and that is comfortable finding the right balance of algorithmic performance and simplicity to reduce time-to-market. You will: Increase existing entity recognition and relation linking model coverage to extract more classes. Extend existing document import, parsing, and modeling pipelines to support new kinds of documents and file types. Improve performance of entity recognition and relation linking models for document parsing by trying new models, adding new features, and experimenting with different architectures. Help procure, curate, and QA annotated data for new document parsing applications as well as for computer vision applications. In the medium term, aid in the development of instance segmentation, generative, and other image model types for photography applications. In the long term, support or independently drive discovery of novel applications of ML to text and image content import, classification, and transformation.   Qualifications You Have: A Bachelor's degree with 2-3 years of experience in software development or a MSc/PhD with 0-2 years of experience. Demonstrated technical leadership and initiative in previous projects. The ability to convert open-ended product requirements into concrete ML solutions with a well-defined scope. A strong modeling background, and experience building pipelines, modeling, and experimenting in frameworks like Keras (preferred) or Pytorch. Experience building models for NLP applications (preferred) or CV applications. Experience building services to serve ML applications in real-time, using technologies like Flask and MySQL. Working knowledge with cloud services like AWS, GCS, and their command line utilities.

AE Studio is an LA-based company focused on increasing human agency while maintaining our ineffable culture and whimsy. If the work diminishes agency, we may simply decide to ""eff"" it after all. In our Venice CA office and our respective domiciles live a team of highly-skilled developers, data scientists, and dubiously-lucid humorists building agency-increasing products you may recall from such sentences as the one in this paragraph. We've worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you've probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!).  More specifically, we deploy the proceeds from our consulting work in development and data science to support and incubate internal skunkworks projects (anything interesting  you're  working on right now?).

Willingness to learn our systems (wait, we have systems?)  Full-time availability–but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we'll even help!  Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously  Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English.

In traditional banks, back offices are filled with humans. Their job usually is to verify physical documents (like government issued IDs, proof of address, proof of income documents etc), fill out forms, and search for people on google (no joke) and other sites. Instead of using people, we want to use machines to do these things. Here is our reasoning behind this: If we can automate the back office, then we won't have costs associated with customers like traditional banks. We would be able to offer state of the art finance products to everyone at a low cost, regardless of their bank balance. (Usually banks charge monthly management fees to people with lower bank balance, aka people with lower socioeconomic status - we want to break that cycle). Check this out: https://medium.com/synapsefi/insto-instant-account-opening-a2aac88bc0dd. Everything here uses machine learning, from instant government ID verification, to video authentication to social media verification. These are the kind of tools you will be building. In order to be successful at Synapse, you should have: An ability to work independently within a small, fast-paced team An entrepreneurial spirit and unrelenting passion to deliver the best service possible The ability to implement feedback, learn quickly, and contribute new ideas A general concern for the wellbeing of others and the desire to work on problems that maximize a positive future for humanity Key Qualifications: Experience with Python, with strong love for writing tests Experience with Tensorflow, PyTorch, Numpy Experience with working on computer vision or NLP problems Ability to write clean, reliable code that can be easily maintained Ability to solve problems and identify areas of improvement Along with Python, we use flask to build APIs, docker to containerize them, rancher to deploy and orchestrate, AWS to host, CircleCI to test (and obviously Github in between all this).

We have assembled a dedicated team with diverse backgrounds to support more than 100,000 homes bought and sold with us and the customers who have selected Opendoor as a trusted partner in handling one of their largest financial transactions. But the work is far from over as we continue to grow in new markets. Transforming the real estate industry takes tenacity and dedication. It takes problem solvers and builders. It takes a tight knit community of teammates doing the best work of their lives, pushing one another to transform a complicated process into a simple one. So where do you fit in? Whether you’re passionate about real estate, people, numbers, words, code, or strategy - we have a place for you. Real estate is broken. Come help us fix it.   Our Team: Our mandate is to demonstrate profitable data breakthroughs.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=03212af24c46b180&from=web&vjs=3,510,Threat Researcher (Remote),CrowdStrike,California,"At CrowdStrike we’re on a mission - to stop breaches. Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. Because of that we’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and talent. Our culture was purpose-built to be remote first, and we offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. If you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology with a team that makes a difference every day, let’s talk. The CrowdStrike Malware Research Center is the core of Falcon’s malware detection and response capabilities. The team has a focus on understanding the threat landscape and sets the target for what Falcon should be identifying and preventing. Additionally, the MRC is responsible for understanding our capabilities, and mapping how well our machine learning and behavioral protection capabilities are doing against those threats. Where there is a gap, the MRC takes action to improve our detection stance, and improve our overall protection story. There are many parts of CrowdStrike working towards protecting customer environments, and the MRC works across all of them to ensure we are on target and providing the best protection for our current threat landscape. Threat Research Team Leading the charge for understanding the activity of malware today is the Threat Research team. With a focus on malware research, the primary role of the team is to understand relevant threats and techniques used in malware that is threatening our customer’s business. The challenge is the enormous scale of malware today and sheer number of samples required to be addressed. This takes a more creative approach than traditional Anti-Virus research, focusing on one sample at a time. The modern threat lab requires an economy of scale through automation and machine learning to allow people to focus on new learnings, and let systems continue to identify malware based on what the team has learned. About the Role: The Threat Analyst will take input from many sources and validate if those threats are something Falcon can mount an effective defense against. The analysis can range from simple execution and review of the behaviors to reverse engineering. As Falcon is first a behavior-based system, understanding how the threat is working and what it is doing to interact with the host environment can be important. The Threat Analyst will be expected to use the appropriate technique to efficiently understand the threat to identify how to best mitigate it. Additionally, this role will be looked on as the go to person when new threats are reported for understanding those threats and formulating an opinion on how we should be thinking about the threat. Leaning on a proven track record of threat analysis, the successful candidate will be comfortable working to focus on the appropriate threats and clearly communicating key technical details of those threats. As the gateway to the response organization for many new threats, good cross team collaboration skills are important. Clear, effective communication of technical details in a means which is actionable is the key to success. Another aspect of the position is working with the engineering team to define automation improvements and process automation to reduce time and manual effort in the analysis of threats. Like communicating the threat details, prioritizing automation tasks and features will help define success of the role. Being able to understand the bigger picture of threat analysis and convey that to the engineering team which may not be familiar with the process will be required. The team will look to the successful candidate to help define and prioritize the roadmap for analysis automation. These are the tools and systems which will ultimately automate manual data collection so more time can be spent on understanding the threat.
