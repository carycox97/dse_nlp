https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9e8950e06a36982c&from=web&vjs=3,350,Applied Scientist,Afresh,"San Francisco, CA","Afresh is on a mission to reduce food waste and increase access to nutritious food globally by transforming the fresh food supply chain. Our solution is currently deployed in hundreds of grocery stores across the United States and is on track to reduce 30 million pounds of food waste per year with our existing customers alone. By 2021, we're aiming to reduce food waste by a quarter billion pounds per year.   The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.   We are looking for an Applied Scientist to lead the R&D work at Afresh. You will take your existing knowledge of forecasting, simulation, and stochastic optimization and apply it to the challenging and important problem of perishable inventory control. You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core replenishment system. This will include modeling consumer demand, item-level perishability, and complex multi-echelon supply chains. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.  What you will do:  You will work on improving the core models of our system: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and simulation. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges. You will model the complex problems of inventory decay, promotions, price elasticity, and inventory uncertainty, and implement solutions to multi-stage and multi-echelon inventory optimization problems.  In your first 3 months, you will acquire an encyclopedic knowledge of perishable inventory control and Afresh's core decision making problem. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and simulation tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting, ordering, or simulation models.  By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our core modeling system.  By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core system and led research into new product areas (warehouse level replenishment, production planning).  We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.  What skills and experience do you need?  5+ years of industrial or academic experience building systems that deal with large-scale decision making under uncertainty. Some possible prior research areas are inventory optimization, supply chain management, network optimization, forecasting, game theory, decision analysis, or stochastic and approximate dynamic programming.  Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English and easily translate business requirements into constrained optimization problems.  Ability to independently deliver high quality software implementations of your solutions in the Python data stack (numpy/torch/pandas/etc). Knowing Python before joining is not required.  PhD in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related quantitative field   Founded in 2017, Afresh is the first A.I.-powered fresh food optimization  platform  for grocery chains. We have partnered with several large grocers representing hundreds of stores and >$10B in revenue. Our cutting-edge AI  research  has been published in top journals (e.g., ICML). We’re backed by some of the top investors in grocery and tech including Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm), Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitch Fix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram), Food Retail Ventures, Maersk Growth, and Impact Engine. We are building a vibrant, diverse, and inclusive team that embodies our company’s values: proactivity, kindness, candor, and humility. We aspire to continually grow as individuals and as an organization to live these values and realize our mission. We earnestly believe that Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by employing novel technology—and to have a ton of fun along the way.

These maps were patchworks of military sketches, captain logs, and merchant updates, and over the centuries became more and more detailed. In an era of growing vehicle automation, having up-to-date and highly accurate maps is equally critical to ensuring safe vehicle operation both on the highway and on surface roads. Yet map building remains an extensive and highly manual process, meaning real-time high definition map updates often propagate through to the user with a delay of months or years from the date when they were collected, rendering them useless beyond limited driver-assist functions. It is time for a new paradigm. At TRI, our work is guided by a dedication to safety – in how we research, develop, and validate the performance of vehicle technology to benefit society. As a subsidiary of Toyota, TRI is fueled by a diverse and inclusive community of people who carry invaluable leadership, experience, and ideas from industry-leading companies. Over half of our technical team carries Ph.D. degrees. We’re continually searching for the world’s best talent ‒ people who are ready to define the new world of mobility with us! We strive to build a company that helps our people thrive, achieve work-life balance, and bring their best selves to work. At TRI, you will have the opportunity to enjoy the best of both worlds ‒ a fun start-up environment with forward-thinking people who enjoy solving tough problems and the financial backing to successfully achieve our goals. Come work with TRI if you’re interested in transforming mobility through designing safer cars, enabling the elderly to age in place, or designing alternative fuel sources. Start your impossible with us. The Automated Mapping Platform (AMP) team is responsible for developing a new high definition mapping cloud platform by integrating sensor data from vehicles and global imagery from satellites. It is an open software platform based on a contribution model: participating developers accept that vehicles deploying their application or software contribute anonymized sensor data to the platform. In return, every developer has easy, safe, open and sustainable access to high definition maps from across industries, fleets, and carmakers. One-stop-shop open APIs that allow developers to focus on building software. No need to worry about specific map implementations and maintenance, just pull down the data needed whenever it is needed. Updated maps will use mainstream camera data, the map update and building process will be increasingly automated, and satellite imagery will help build out a global road network where vehicles are not present in sufficient numbers to support a data pipeline. The role of the Data Fusion, Automated Mapping Platform (AMP) team is to process and fuse sensor and camera data from diverse vehicle sources with a high definition map developed using aerial and satellite imagery. This team will act as a bridge between the Automated Mapping Platform team at TRI-AD in Tokyo and the Localization and Mapping team at TRI. The expected output will be an accurate, scalable, semantic HD map of the world.  Responsibilities: Collaborate with other software engineers and research scientists to develop state-of-the-art localization, mapping and data fusion algorithms for autonomous vehicles. Support the development of large data sets and data pipelines for system training and evaluation. Develop high-quality software designs that allow for both high-performance and maintainable software Live and breathe the software practices that produce maintainable code, including automated testing, continuous integration, code style conformity, and code review. Create and improve services and systems to generate map data based on algorithms developed in house based on probe, aerial and satellite imagery Create services and products that serve world-scale data Involved in the process of maintaining the map database at nationwide/worldwide scale Educate those around you to the ways of good coding practices  Qualifications: Ph.D., M.S. or B.S. in Computer Science or a related field 2-8 years experience in related role Strong organizational and communication skills; great teammate.

Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act. Sisu leverages the massive amounts of data available within private, first-party data warehouses, which capture a real-time, structured view of organizational behavior. By monitoring the performance of key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn, and their relationships to interactions between key factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels, we can help users make better decisions.
