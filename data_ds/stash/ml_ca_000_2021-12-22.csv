For more details, read on!  About the Company:  We all waste a staggering amount of time (~33%) because we have no idea where we are spending it. Worse yet, we continue to operate in a factory model that simply does not apply to creative work. Our big bet is that by understanding time, we'll be able to move away from it as a unit of value. In the future knowledge economy (lawyers, accountants, engineers), contributions will be assessed on value added, not the underlying time spent adding it.  Ambitious mission to say the least, so where are we starting? We have created a new market category called  Time Automation  that automates the timekeeping process for professionals and allows us to collect time data at scale. Before TBP, professionals had to manually record every six minutes of their day into antiquated timekeeping software. Not anymore.  We are a Series B company (>$55M in venture capital from Tier 1 funds) that has assembled some of the best builders, designers, and product minds in tech—and we all have one thing in common: we are deeply motivated by our mission  to return time .  We need to find like-minded colleagues who want to join us on our journey and are willing to spend their time solving time. It will be a long road but if we're even half right, we'll change the way work is measured and performed forever.  About the Role:  Come lead our Product Automation Strategy and use of ML to return human time as our Director of Engineering for Machine Learning. This role is responsible for creating a system that fundamentally understands how people work, then applying this the problem we are solving today of shortening the time users spend converting work activities into timesheets to deliver on our promise to help timekeepers bill more time,  in   less time.  While we build out our burgeoning ML group, this role requires you to develop short and mid term strategy, recruiting of a world class engineering team, and relentless product execution by bringing real-world use of machine learning and coupling it in a consumer-grade software experience for enterprise customers.  As the first leadership hire dedicated to this core company function, you will set the culture and approach — boldly differentiating us from our competition and stirring the imagination of the many customers we serve and will serve tomorrow on the possibilities of Time Automation for their industries (yes, beyond legal).  You will be responsible for a full stack team that will include the data storage and processing infrastructure, the cleansing and analysis of the data, model creation and delivery, integration of those models into backend services and the presentation layer, and regular feedback telemetry monitoring for in-field performance. You will be broadly empowered to make both the technology selections and engineering process decisions to optimally deliver.  Core Duties:  Build, own, and drive our Automation strategy and technology, and in particular our Machine Learning and other Predictive Services work to help minimize time and effort for timesheet creation.  Collaborate with the Design team to create a design language that helps our users understand how TBP works for them, demystifying the automation.  Lead our Engineering efforts to develop a world class infrastructure and pipeline for data, machine learning, and model management that allows us to improve the product at blistering speed (model creation, management, and deployment).  Deliver regular releases of models and service releases to improve the products automation capabilities.  Collaborate with Sales, Product Marketing, and Customer Success so they effectively speak to our automation capabilities for their stakeholders, driving product sales and adoption.  Maintain a strong understanding of customer behavior, the competitive landscape, and industry trends and meet with our stakeholders regularly.  Develop our forward strategy with data and new products we can create and sell.

If you're close to our SF or LA offices, we'd love to have you into the office at least once a week once it's safe (targeting 2022).  Compensation:  Competitive salary, generous equity, comprehensive medical/dental/vision coverage with covered premiums, 401(k), additional benefits including wellness/commuter/FSA stipends.  Visa Sponsorship:  Unfortunately we are unable to sponsor visas at this time.  What happens if my kid or I are sick on a workday?  Take all the time you need! We'll cover for you.

The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.  We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is  truly  saying.  We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results. Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

In particular, the SFA is developing understanding and tools – novel sensors and observation platforms, airborne remote sensing products, Earth system simulators – to measure and predict how droughts, early snowmelt, and other perturbations impact downstream water availability and biogeochemical cycling at episodic to decadal timescales.  In this exciting role, you will be responsible for synthesizing large temporal and spatial datasets from satellite/airborne remote sensing as well as bedrock-through-canopy datasets on water and nutrient cycling, ecohydrology and biogeochemistry in a mountainous watershed in the Upper Colorado River Basin. The primary task is focused on identifying co-variability among bedrock-to-canopy data layers, characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of mountainous ecosystems and biogeochemical functioning, and testing various scaling theories/methods.   What You Will Do:  Work collaboratively with a vibrant, large, multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional team to integrate diverse datasets for the spatiotemporal characterization of the watershed.  Analyze data and extract patterns and correlations using appropriate data mining methods.  Develop and implement machine learning based algorithms for integrating spatiotemporal datasets including remote sensing and ground-based measurements for watershed characterization.  Developing a watershed-to-basin scaling construct that can be used to guide data acquisition and Earth systems model parameterization.  Author peer-reviewed conference or journal papers, contribute to project products, and contribute to grant proposals.   What is Required:  Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences/Engineering, Data Science, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, or other related technical disciplines.  Understanding of watershed hydrology, landscape evolution and ecosystem processes.  Demonstrated experience with machine learning methods.

Our first A.I.-powered solution optimizes ordering, forecasting, and store operations for fresh food departments in brick-and-mortar grocers. With our Fresh Operating System, regional and national grocery retailers have placed $8.4 billion in produce orders across the US and we've helped our partners prevent 6.9 million pounds of food from going to waste. Working at Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by leveraging uncommonly impactful software – we hope you'll join us!  About the role  The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.   We are looking for an Applied Scientist to lead the R&D work at Afresh. You will take your existing knowledge of forecasting, simulation, and stochastic optimization and apply it to the challenging and important problem of perishable inventory control. You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core replenishment system. This will include modeling consumer demand, item-level perishability, and complex multi-echelon supply chains. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.  You will work on improving the core models of our system: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and simulation. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges. You will model the complex problems of inventory decay, promotions, price elasticity, and inventory uncertainty, and implement solutions to multi-stage and multi-echelon inventory optimization problems.  In your first 3 months, you will acquire an encyclopedic knowledge of perishable inventory control and Afresh's core decision making problem. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and simulation tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting, ordering, or simulation models.  By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our core modeling system.  By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core system and led research into new product areas (warehouse level replenishment, production planning).  We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.   Skills and experience The following represent attributes our ideal candidate possesses. We encourage all highly-qualified candidates to apply, even if they do not fulfill all the listed criteria.   5+ years of industrial or academic experience building systems that deal with large-scale decision making under uncertainty. Some possible prior research areas are inventory optimization, supply chain management, network optimization, forecasting, game theory, decision analysis, or stochastic and approximate dynamic programming.  Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English and easily translate business requirements into constrained optimization problems.  Ability to independently deliver high quality software implementations of your solutions in the Python data stack (numpy/torch/pandas/etc). Knowing Python before joining is not required.  PhD in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related quantitative field   About Afresh  Founded in 2017, Afresh is working on the #1 solution to curb climate change: reducing food waste. By combining human insight and transformative technology, we're helping grocers provide fresher food to customers at more affordable prices.

Final date:  Saturday, Apr 30, 2022 at 11:59pm (Pacific Time) Applications will continue to be accepted until this date, but those received after the review date will only be considered if the position has not yet been filled. Position description  The Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of California, Davis invites applications for two Postdoctoral Researchers.  POSITION DESCRIPTION: We are thrilled to announce the immediate availability of up to two (2) fully funded Postdoctoral Researcher positions in the joint laboratory of Drs. Daniel Starr and G.W. Gant Luxton. The Starr/Luxton Lab is a part of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology within the College of Biological Sciences at the University of California, Davis. We are looking to recruit passionate scientists (Ph.D. and/or M.D. required) who will spearhead our NIH- and Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group-funded efforts to understand how the nucleus enables cells to sense and respond to physical forces through a process known as mechanotransduction, which is essential for cellular differentiation, division, migration, and survival. The selected candidates will work at the interface of biomechanical engineering, physical cell biology, and developmental genetics to address the following questions: 1) How are linker of nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (LINC) complexes assembled in the nuclear envelope?; 2) How do LINC complexes influence the assembly of functional nucleoli within the nucleoplasm?; and 3) How do LINC complexes control the mechanical properties of cells and tissues? To do this, the candidates will use a powerful combination of advanced microscopy, C. elegans genetics, machine learning, novel high-throughput CRISPR-based genome-wide screens performed in mammalian tissue culture cells, small molecule biochemical screens, and synthetic biology. The specific project to be pursued will be developed jointly by the candidates and PIs upon hiring. Furthermore, the selected candidates will be responsible for the organization of their notes, data, and analyses, the presentation of their findings at weekly lab meetings, the execution of basic lab maintenance jobs, and the creation of a positive working environment. Importantly, impaired LINC complex-dependent mechanotransduction underlies the pathogenesis of the following human diseases: cancer, cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy, and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, LINC complexes are required for the following basic cellular processes: DNA damage repair, meiotic chromosome pairing, migration, mitosis, and polarization. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of mechanotransduction promises to advance multiple fields of cell biology as well as human health.  SALARY RANGE: $54,540-$65,292 [100% annual], commensurate with qualifications and experience.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=e8c59cc8eb2c69a2&from=web&vjs=3,650,SENIOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST (SPECIALIST),California Public Utilities Commission,"Sacramento County, CA","Job Description and Duties  The California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) has implemented the requirement that all state employees attest to their vaccination status. Employees are required to indicate whether they are vaccinated, unvaccinated, or if they choose not to disclose their vaccination status. As an additional health and safety standard to protect the state workforce and the public it serves, CalHR is also implementing COVID-19 testing of all state employees working on site (including field sites) if they are unvaccinated, vaccinated but choose not to provide documentation, or choosing not to disclose their vaccination status. Any employee seeking exemption from COVID-19 testing or wearing a face covering must provide evidence of vaccination. This requirement is subject to change depending upon updated Federal, State, and/or local requirements and guidance.   Positions at the Water Boards may be eligible for telework with in-person attendance based on the operational needs of the position.   Due to the COVID-19 public health emergency, applying electronically is highly encouraged.  The State Water Resources Control Board’s Division of Water Rights has an opening for a Senior Environmental Scientist (Specialist) (SR ES Specialist). The position is located at 1001 I Street, 14 Floor, Sacramento, right in the heart of downtown next to light rail stations and other public transportation. Division staff are currently maximizing telecommute options as part of the state’s response to COVID-19.   Duties: The Division of Water Rights is tasked with administration and oversight of California’s water rights system. The State Water Board’s system for managing its water right data is outdated and inadequate to support water rights administration. As climate change adds to the challenge of efficiently administering water rights, as more frequent droughts will challenge the state’s ability to respond effectively without sufficient data management resources, and as demands for water throughout the watershed outstrip this physically limited resource, updating our water rights data management system is a critical imperative. Recognizing this need, the State has authorized and funded an ambitious multi-year project to replace the aged electronic Water Rights Information Management System (eWRIMS).  The incumbent will work with a collaborative team representing the Division and guiding the development of the Board’s new water right data system, and will serve a critical role in evaluating how environmental science data is best incorporated and represented in the Division’s data management efforts. The incumbent will also coordinate closely with staff from the Office of the Delta Watermaster, Office of Information Management and Assessment (OIMA), Division of Information Technology (DIT), the Board’s business change management consultants, as well as the California Department of Technology (CDT).

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=be3494d584aaa962&from=web&vjs=3,640,Research Engineer,Generally Intelligent,"San Francisco, CA","Summary We started Generally Intelligent because we believe that software with human-level intelligence will have a transformative impact on the world. We’re dedicated to ensuring that that impact is a positive one. We have enough funding to last for decades, and our backers include Y Combinator, researchers from OpenAI, Lightspeed, Threshold, and many others. This role is about creating software to support our scientific and engineering-driven approach to developing machines with human level intelligence. About the role You will run experiments in order to more deeply understand both the current solutions (e.g., what specific deep neural networks are learning) and the current problems (e.g., what about the training data makes it difficult to learn the patterns that seem so obvious to us). These experiments include changing the network architecture as well as the training data distribution (our data is mostly simulated). You will, in the course of running those experiments, spend most of your time creating reusable tools and systems required to actually run them and understand the results. Examples include visualizations for the data, changes to the simulator to create new data, and code for running large scale network architecture search across hundreds or thousands of containers. You will mostly pair program with other researchers and engineers. We find pair programming particularly useful because ML code needs a high level of correctness, and it’s helpful to have two minds working on a really hard problem. Plus it’s just more fun! You will participate in (our own unique version of) daily stand-ups, research planning, strategy discussions, paper clubs, learn-a-thons, and other activities designed to give us space to learn and plan and think. About you You are a software engineer who is passionate about understanding how the mind works. You want to build machines that truly understand the world in order to usher in a new era of abundance and flourishing for humanity. You do  not  need to have significant prior experience with machine learning (though it’s certainly a plus!) We’re very open to helping you learn to become a great machine learning engineer. We have done this for some current team members, and have a number of resources that make it very easy to get up-to-speed quickly. You  do  need to be a really good software engineer. Machine learning is 80%+ software engineering, so you should be very comfortable with Python. Other tools we use include PyTorch, docker, numpy, and wandb. About us We believe in working with the absolute best people in the world (which is why we pay top of market) We believe that there is something special about getting the most talented people together in one room, especially for research (which is why we’re fully in-person in SF) We believe that curiosity and personal growth are both extremely important (which is why you will have a $30K+ yearly budget for executive coaching, books, courses, conferences, etc) We believe that it is critical to not just attract great individuals, but build strong relationships between them (whichis why we have quarterly team off-sites, frequent team dinners, and other events) We believe in investing in resources so that you can work more effectively (which is why we have a $250K+ compute budget per person, dedicated contract engineers to support our researchers individually, why we’ve built internal tools to automate hyper-parameter optimization, etc) We believe in creating a culture of science and truth-seeking, where no idea is too crazy to consider and no ideas are considered holy (which is why we encourage questions in the middle of company-wide presentations and why we encourage the most junior members in a meeting to weigh in first) We also believe in creating a culture of psychological safety, where everyone feels able to voice their opinion without fear of judgment (which is why we have “Feelings Friday”, where we have space to share how we felt during the week, and why we have a culture manual with a bunch of small habits that help encourage safe, effective communication) We believe in having fun, and that being in a positive environment isn't just much more productive, it's just a better way to live (which is why we take Friday afternoons off together as a team, joke around, and join in each others’ hobbies, whether it’s D&D or hiking or meditation) We believe that creating software with human level intelligence comes with the responsibility to ensure that it benefits all of humanity, not just a select few (which is why we're creating a public benefit corporation, why we’re interested in safety research, and why we have internal working groups on safety). How to apply All submissions are reviewed by a person, so we encourage you to include a cover letter. If you have any work that you can showcase (open source code, a research paper, a side project, etc), you should certainly include it! We try to reply either way within a week or two at most (usually much sooner). We know that talent comes from many backgrounds, and with many different skills and preferences. That’s why we have a hiring process that gives you the ability to showcase yourself in a variety of different ways, depending on what feels best for you.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=f588b741516691b3&from=web&vjs=3,290,Postdocs in Data Intensive Scientific Machine Learning,"University of California, San Diego","San Diego, CA","We seek exceptional postdoctoral candidates to be hosted at UCSD/HDSI, Columbia, or UCI. These positions have an initial term of one year with the possibility of extension. The starting date is flexible, but no later than Fall 2022. Background The past two decades have witnessed natural disasters and extreme weather events that affect millions of lives. At the same time, the data volume from high-resolution climate models, satellite, in-situ and ground-based measurements have substantially increased to petabyte scales. These new and readily accessible datasets create the previously missing pipeline for scientific machine learning (ML), which in turn can improve our understanding and ability to predict extreme climate events. This project will develop deep latent variable models (LVMs) to discover hidden physical structures in high-dimensional, spatiotemporal data of extreme climate events such as droughts or heatwaves. Our project has three research aims: Aim 1: Discover hidden structures from climate extremes: apply novel deep LVMs, such as sequential variational autoencoders (VAEs) and tensor LVMs, to climate simulation data (and particularly to data composed of sparse observations). These LVMs will be designed to extract hidden low dimensional structures that are evolving in space and time. In turn, these hidden structures will be analyzed within the framework of causal transportability, so that predictions can be transferred from simulations to real-world observations in order to more accurately predict those extreme events. Aim 2: Incorporate physical principles, laws, and constraints into deep LVMs and the hidden structures that they discover. Neural networks will be trained by innovative methods that disentangle latent representations, provide weak supervision, and/or enforce equivariance. Aim 3: Quantify the uncertainty of predictions from deep LVMs. Specific goals are to (i) develop scalable techniques for Bayesian inference in deep LVM models, (ii) design pre-conditioners for Monte Carlo sampling procedures that handle long-tailed distributions, (iii) exploit hidden structures to accelerate methods for variational inference (VI), obtain more robust estimates, and improve statistical calibration, and (iv) investigate hybrid methods that combine Monte Carlo sampling and VI for more accurate posterior inference. Qualifications Ph.D. in computer science, physics, mathematics, engineering, or other related fields. Strong interests in machine learning and earth science, especially deep learning, dynamical systems, spatiotemporal statistics and optimization. Prior experience working with large-scale data sets. Papers in top machine learning conferences and/or scientific journals are a plus. Communication, presentation, writing, and teamwork skills.
