Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.  About the Team:  Our small engineering team works on challenging problems every day. We have a culture that's rooted in constantly learning and improving, and our engineers are encouraged to think big and experiment with new ideas.

Our journey is just beginning as we continue to build new products from the ground up and tackle exciting challenges at scale. Today, we're working on a broad range of areas to grow our ads product to drive more value to our users and advertisers.  As a manager on the Monetization ML team, you'll lead and grow a team that is focused on generating revenue for the success of the company and mission to share and grow the world's knowledge. To fully achieve this, we need to make sure that the knowledge on Quora will improve and last forever. Revenue from our monetization efforts plays a critical role in empowering us to do that. You'll work closely with other product development and machine learning leaders to plan, prioritize, and deliver scalable, reliable products that delight our users, advertisers and businesses on Quora.  Responsibilities:  Lead and grow a team of machine learning engineers to deliver high-impact projects within Ads, Business Products and Subscriptions.

Reporting to the Provost and the President as a member of the University’s leadership team, the Dean will shape strategic initiatives to deepen the connection between art, design, and the liberal arts and sciences as they lead the Northwest's oldest school of art and design in its new chapter as a college of Willamette University.

Originally founded in 1909 as the Museum Art School, PNCA was the first school to offer professional arts education in the Pacific Northwest. Together, the four schools of the University enroll approximately 2500 undergraduate and graduate students and employ more than 360 faculty. The College of Arts and Sciences offers bachelor's degrees in over 30 fields and has combined degrees with the MBA in the Atkinson School and the JD in the College of Law as well as a combined BS/MS in Data Science.
