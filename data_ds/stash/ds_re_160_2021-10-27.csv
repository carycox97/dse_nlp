https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=e6d218c83491c884&from=web&vjs=3,290,"Senior Data Scientist, MediaGuard",Human Security,"New York, NY","At HUMAN, we know who’s real. We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud.  We stop them . We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. Detection@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We're a group of data professionals and security experts who build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception.   Countering bot fraud is not a situation where all the interesting data science problems have already been solved. Every week there are brand new challenges that require novel approaches.  - Austin L, Senior Data Scientist, MediaGuard The human we need for this role will work on  MediaGuard : our product for advertising platforms. MediaGuard provides real-time insight for ad-tech customers on which advertising opportunities are fraudulent bot-driven events.  What you'll do: Responsibilities Write ‘bot markers’ which consistently find fraud today, and work with other senior members of the team to develop flexible frameworks that can find the fraud of tomorrow. Become a domain expert in ad-tech and ad-serving, allowing you to develop the best strategies for marker development. Work with engineering managers to scope team OKRs and then deliver your own on time and on-spec. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to design new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Take a prominent role in building data-science toolsets that empower the whole team, especially more junior team members.  Who you are: Background and Skillset You’ve consistently delivered algorithmic software projects that demonstrably solved a business problem well. This means you can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use for a given goal, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, ad-tech work requires learning the intricacies of an infamously complex digital supply chain and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).Build analysis toolkits and platforms that empower our whole team to work more effectively. You know enough about how the internet/web works to give a rudimentary explanation of DNS / HTTP / JavaScript. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.  Our culture and benefits: Helping you do the best work of your life Focus Alongside the feel-good factor of knowing your work each day counters cyber-crime, we designed our cultural norms and work benefits to bring out your best. We strongly value deep work, so we practice company-wide Zoom-free Fridays . This provides a handy backdrop for a related initiative: ‘R&D Research Friday’: half a day each week isolated from day-to-day work for all our people to focus on trying new ideas, personal learning and career development. It’s backed financially too by a generous Learning & Development stipend. HUMAN's company-wide ""no meeting Fridays"" is like a breathe of fresh air after other jobs with the constant context switching of meetings interrupting one's flow. -  Adrian W, Principal Data Engineer.   Flexibility At HUMAN we’re fully committed to flexible working arrangements and making remote work...work. But what does this mean in practice? It means we supply you with a company Macbook Pro and generous home-office stipend, we pay for your mobile and internet bills and we recreate that shared-office-lunching vibe with expensable lunch delivery on Wednesdays. At our major hubs we also have physical spaces too, so you can get that in-person experience when it makes sense for you and your team-mates.",23 days ago,

A place where you can really contribute, and not just be another PR in the pipeline? Want to join a team of talented developers that enjoy working together and all have a say in how things are built? Looking for a small team you can join? A place where you can really contribute, and not just be another PR in the pipeline? Want to join a team of talented developers that enjoy working together and all have a say in how things are built? TLDR: Let's get to the point. You're our machine learning systems builder. You use technology to make training and deploying models as seamless as possible, because human time is much more expensive than machine time. Problem TLDR: A well functioning training and deployment environment accelerates the feedback loop and time-to-market for ML algorithms. We can't forget about observability either. Problem II: Deploying machine learning models in production requires thinking and working with non-deterministic output where the grittiness is in the data (potentially unversioned), not the code. This has inspired a new generation of platforms for deployment and ops but they are still a few years away from completely solving this problem space. We need someone who lives and breathes containerization, scaling, distributed systems and enjoys diving into algorithms as well, since optimizing an ML algorithms comes with nuanced tradeoffs around accuracy and performance. In this case performance can be ambiguous - it is training time, inference cost, inference time, or deployment time. You're here to help us define and balance these tradeoffs. Scope: You'll get to architect our system and lay the foundation for the future from both a technology and a system design perspective. Once you're done we'll have no problem seamlessly deploying multiple models a day, being made aware of drift as soon as it happens and falling back to old models when new ones unexpectedly fail. You'll work closely with our our Eng team to ensure that we optimize the design of the entire system and make good tradeoffs along the way. You'll also collaborate on the algorithm side, as it never hurt to have another collaborator, much in the same way that Random Forests outperform Decision Trees. Areas you're comfortable with: You're familiar with distributed systems and data processing frameworks such as Scala and Spark. You've used ML systems such as sklearn, tensorflow and/or pytorch. Yes, other languages/frameworks are fine as long as you can articulate how you've used the technology to solve similar problems. You don't mind writing SQL as necessary, but probably wouldn't operationalize parameterized notebooks, even if you could. Matrix multiplication is something you dream about. I'm only half kidding here as it underpins just about every aspect of modern ml and contains the keys to optimizing any algorithm using it. Designing an ML deployment system from scratch is something that excites you and you're able to clearly articulate the tradeoffs of different approaches and platforms. You've likely built some version of this before, or are at least intrigued by the idea of serverless inferencing. Philosophies: You strongly believe that action creates information. You want to work on a small team and have lots of responsibility. You look forward to being scrappy and enjoy overcoming challenges. You are willing to admit when you don't know something and bring in others to help you figure it out.  We are focused on building a diverse and inclusive workforce.

Machine Learning plays a vital role - from personalizing the experience for each member to improving how we bring content from around the world onto the Netflix service. Doing this at scale while rapidly innovating is far from sorted out. The ML Platform Experience (MLX) team exists to enable the people who do ML and Data Science at Netflix to have the most productive and prolific periods of their careers. Over the past several years we developed Metaflow to make Data Scientists more productive, but our work has just begun. The MLX team is looking for a Senior Software Engineer who can help us build first generation bandits & Reinforcement Learning infrastructure for a growing set of explore/exploit algorithms in personalization, messaging, growth and beyond. Opportunities to make an impact: Help define our technical vision for bandit infrastructure - from logging to training to serving Accelerate the process of standing up a new bandit/RL algorithm and increase our capacity to experiment Scale the work of ML Engineers by providing centrally leveraged infrastructure About Us We are a small team with diverse backgrounds. We come from 3 continents and have a range of technical experience: from building large scale mission critical services to Computer Vision research to crafting delightful user experiences to building production search & recommendations systems. Collectively, we have decades of experience building ML platforms. We share a passion for helping humans become more productive. We find strength in diversity because it will make us better at entertaining the world. Inclusion is threaded into the daily work we do; we make space for everyone on the team to do their best work, and we hope that you'll be able to envision yourself working with us. Our values: We fanatically support all ML practitioners so that they can succeed We walk in the shoes of our users to guide our work through empathy We start slow to take our users farther, rather than moving fast and breaking things We treat technology as a means to improve the practice of ML, not a goal in itself We make an impact equally through big efforts and many small wins About You You're passionate about helping humans become more productive. Our team values resonate with you, and perhaps you've been living them. You believe that when it comes to building solid platforms, the code and the build artifacts are just the beginning. You consciously prioritize approachable documentation, responsive customer support, rock solid operations, and extensive, repeatable testing. You possess the skills below. You're fluent in a mainstream programming language (Python, Java, Scala, Golang, C++ or similar) and comfortable working in a polyglot environment. You have working knowledge under the hood of your primary language down to the OS level (e.g., compiler/interpreter, filesystem, concurrency, memory). You've built widely adopted infrastructure for technical users (ideally ML practitioners or data consumers/producers). A plus if you've worked with Spark. You can leverage your maths/stats background to quickly dive into academic papers on multi-armed bandits and Reinforcement Learning. A plus if you already have experience with RL or bandits. You can quickly survey and make sense of complex systems. For example, mapping out the data flow across interlocking microservices. You are a cross-functional technical leader; you're able to rally not only the technology but the people involved in bringing new systems to life that span multiple teams. We look forward to discussing more about Netflix culture, our approach to Inclusion & Diversity and what it's like to work at Netflix.

With experts in software engineering, bioinformatics and program management, we focus on developing and applying technology tools and techniques to empower decision-making and accelerate the discovery in translational research. We work with some of the top research organizations and facilities in the country including multiple institutes at the National Institutes of health (NIH).  Axle  is seeking a highly ambitious, adaptable, structured, and detail oriented  Research Associate  to join our rare disease informatics team at Bethesda. The ideal candidate is willing to work between 30-40 hours per week and has the desire to have NIH listed on their resume. Currently, there are about 7,000-10,000 known rare diseases that affect people in the US, yet only a few hundred (less than 5%) have a treatment and even fewer a cure. A rare disease is defined in US law (Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983,[1] Rare Diseases Act (RDA) of 2002[2]) as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Most rare diseases affect far fewer patients than this, with most rare diseases affecting only a few hundreds to thousands of patients. Collectively, however, rare diseases are not rare at all, and in total are estimated to affect as many as 25-30 million patients in the US, making rare diseases a large public health consideration. The ORDR’s GARD information center was established in 2003 under a Congressional Mandate (RDA 2002), and is a federally funded program that has an essential role in the dissemination of public health information to rare disease researchers, clinicians, and patients that is freely accessible to the public. However, obtaining accurate, comprehensive, timely, and objective information on rare diseases is often difficult, given the large number of rare diseases, rapidly evolving science (especially related to genomics), diverse data sources, and inconsistent nomenclature and ontologies for rare disease classification, among other issues. Recently, GARD has been undergoing a re-envisioning and re-design based on a Neo4j knowledge graph database that integrates rare disease data from multiple sources to keep the information on ~6,000 different rare diseases in GARD up-to-date and useful to the patient and clinical research communities. Research tools, artificial intelligent models, data visualization and informatics infrastructure based on the knowledge graph database will be developed to support rare diseases research and clinical activities, and to answer rare disease research questions likely to inform rare disease research prioritization. [1] Orphan Drug Act of 1983, amended for prevalence 1984. Pub.L. 97-414 [2] Rare Diseases Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-280 Responsibilities : Work collaboratively with data scientists and application developers to develop informatics infrastructure and support for rare diseases research. Query the existing GARD knowledge graph database for rare diseases data, such as disease classification/ontologies coding (e.g., ICD 10), genetics, clinical characteristics/phenotypic information, diagnosis, and treatment, among others. Collect, quality check, process and integrate data from publicly available data and information resources. Develop a Neo4j database for data management. Develop APIs for user access to the existing knowledge graph database. Apply machine learning and/or natural language processing approaches for data mapping and knowledge extraction. Qualifications: Associate or Bachelor’s degree or enrolled in an accredited Associate or Bachelor’s degree program n Computer Science, Data Science, Bioinformatics, Information Systems or a related field. Good understanding of principles and concepts in database management and software development. Familiarity with Linux/Unix operating system. Familiarity with one or more programing languages, such as Python, Perl, Java etc. Experience in database management, web application and/or API development is preferred. Good understanding of principles and concepts of data mining. Experience in machine learning, deep learning and/or natural language processing is highly preferred.
