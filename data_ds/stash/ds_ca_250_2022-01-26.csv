Our first A.I.-powered solution optimizes ordering, forecasting, and store operations for fresh food departments in brick-and-mortar grocers. With our Fresh Operating System, regional and national grocery retailers have placed $1.6 billion in produce orders across the US and we've helped our partners prevent 6.9 million pounds of food from going to waste. Working at Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by leveraging uncommonly impactful software – we hope you'll join us!  About the role  The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.   We are looking for an Applied Scientist to lead the R&D work at Afresh. You will take your existing knowledge of forecasting, simulation, and stochastic optimization and apply it to the challenging and important problem of perishable inventory control. You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core replenishment system. This will include modeling consumer demand, item-level perishability, and complex multi-echelon supply chains. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.  You will work on improving the core models of our system: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and simulation. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges. You will model the complex problems of inventory decay, promotions, price elasticity, and inventory uncertainty, and implement solutions to multi-stage and multi-echelon inventory optimization problems.  In your first 3 months, you will acquire an encyclopedic knowledge of perishable inventory control and Afresh's core decision making problem. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and simulation tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting, ordering, or simulation models.  By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our core modeling system.  By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core system and led research into new product areas (warehouse level replenishment, production planning).  We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.   Skills and experience The following represent attributes our ideal candidate possesses. We encourage all highly-qualified candidates to apply, even if they do not fulfill all the listed criteria.   5+ years of industrial or academic experience building systems that deal with large-scale decision making under uncertainty. Some possible prior research areas are inventory optimization, supply chain management, network optimization, forecasting, game theory, decision analysis, or stochastic and approximate dynamic programming.  Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English and easily translate business requirements into constrained optimization problems.  Ability to independently deliver high quality software implementations of your solutions in the Python data stack (numpy/torch/pandas/etc). Knowing Python before joining is not required.  PhD in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related quantitative field   About Afresh  Founded in 2017, Afresh is working on the #1 solution to curb climate change: reducing food waste. By combining human insight and transformative technology, we're helping grocers provide fresher food to customers at more affordable prices.  Afresh sits at an incredible intersection of positive social impact, rocket ship financial growth, and cutting-edge technology.

The ECDi MLP team impacts Clinical Operations in trial design, planning and predictive tools. The AI scientist will have the opportunity to get exposure to a range of cross-functional interactions with ECD Informatics, Clinical Science, Clinical Operations, and Quality and across multiple therapeutic areas including oncology, immunology, neuroscience, metabolism, infectious disease, and others. The role will also require cross-functional interactions with research bioinformatics, cancer immunology and developmental science biomarker groups. The AI Scientist will act as a tech lead and be required to establish and apply new AI methods to specific problem domains within those functions. This position requires the incumbent to leverage strong machine learning knowledge and hands-on experience for solving real AI problems. With the supervision and mentoring of the head of ECDi MLP, the AI scientist will develop and implement novel mathematical and algorithmic techniques for machine learning applications of ECD AI projects. There are two studies tracks that can be explored by the newly recruited AI Scientist. One is to apply and develop advanced machine learning/deep learning models to process protein’s amino acids sequence for TCR-antigen interaction prediction in cancer immunology and antibody design/engineer in protein science with varieties of protein-protein interaction scenarios, which can facilitate the drug discovery process in large molecule drug development and cancer immunology therapies. Meanwhile, the team is exploring a new direction of personalized medicine AI for oncology. The focus for this direction is to apply machine learning and deep learning approaches to incorporate genomic information, model and integrate patients biomarker/digital biomarker and EHR data from clinical trials to make multimodality predictions on the patients’ disease progression, response/non-response/survival rates, and accordingly help infer the decision for clinical scientist to design the clinical trials, with built-up AI products speeding up workflows within ECD. Furthermore, the analysis on the patients’ data can help conduct reverse translation study to guide drug/target discoveries in early research. Responsibilities Participate in cutting-edge research in machine intelligence and machine learning applications. Act as an implementer to design and run experiments, including designing and evaluating new algorithms as well as implementing known algorithms. Self-learn ad-hoc machine learning techniques for projects, but receive hands-on experience while working with some of the most esteemed AI Scientists in the industry. Develop solutions for real world problems in clinical trials, drug/target discovery, and biomarker analysis. Provide intellectual support to other MLP team members and share your knowledge and achievements within our MLP team. Qualifications PhD degree in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Bioinformatics, Computational Neuroscience/Biology or a related computational discipline, or equivalent combination of education and practical experience specializing in Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. Experience with applying machine learning and deep learning on omics, protein science or biomarker analysis for translational medicine is a big plus. Experience with transfer learning, meta learning and multimodality predictive modeling is a big plus. 3+ years of relevant professional or academic experience with a proven track record in machine learning or deep learning and software engineering.
