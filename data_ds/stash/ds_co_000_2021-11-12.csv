Our competitors have analyzed our ability to operate overseas and have invested in capabilities such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, small unmanned aircraft systems, artificial intelligence, cyber capabilities, and delivery platforms to offset our strengths while exploiting our perceived weaknesses. These advancing capabilities embolden competitors and adversaries to challenge us at home, looking to threaten our people, our critical infrastructure and our power projection capabilities.  These challenges have generated a strong demand for not only changes in operations, but changes in the corresponding education and training programs supporting force employment, development, and design. You will join a team that performs analysis, assessment and integration in support of the Joint Training, Exercises, and Wargaming Directorate (N&NC/J7).
