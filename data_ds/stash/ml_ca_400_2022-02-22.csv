Final date:  Saturday, Feb 4, 2023 at 11:59pm (Pacific Time) Applications will continue to be accepted until this date, but those received after the review date will only be considered if the position has not yet been filled. Position description  The School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley seeks applications for multiple Postdoctoral Scholars, in the area of Data Science, to help conduct research, teach in, build, and be an integral part of our web-based Master of Information and Data Science program.  The number of positions varies from semester to semester, depending on the needs of the School. Due to budget restrictions, no funding is available for H1B visas.  These are hybrid positions composed of a 67% postdoctoral scholar appointment and 33% lecturer appointment. The position will include teaching sections in our online Master’s program (Spring, Summer, and Fall terms), research collaboration, and participating in the intellectual community at the School and on the Berkeley campus. Research responsibilities include pursuing a self-directed research agenda, presenting current research to the community, and participating in research exchange events.  About The I School  The UC Berkeley School of Information (I School) advances knowledge and practice everywhere humans interact with digital technologies. Through interdisciplinary research and teaching, we are committed to expanding access to information and to improving its usability, reliability, and credibility while preserving security and privacy. This requires the insights of scholars from diverse fields — information and computer science, design, social sciences, management, law, and policy. The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. The I School offers three professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our MIDS program trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree.  Responsibilities  Postdoctoral scholars in the Data Science program at the School of Information pursue their own research agendas with the support and engagement of I School faculty and staff colleagues. Areas of interest might include research design for data science, statistics for data science, data engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, data visualization, data ethics, public interest data science, causal inference, computer vision, or other relevant subfields of data science. While the I School fosters opportunities for postdoctoral scholars to present and discuss their research and receive feedback from peers, successful postdoctoral scholars in our interdisciplinary program will be self-directed, capable of working with a high degree of independence, and thrive in an environment where they are not assigned to a specific lab or existing ongoing project. Teaching responsibilities include planning and leading online classes that focus on active learning: discussions, group activities, examples, and walkthroughs relevant to concepts covered in existing asynchronous materials associated with the course.  In addition to teaching responsibilities, general duties include: hold office hours, assign grades, advise students on Slack, Piazza, or email, prepare course materials (e.g., syllabus, assessment materials), provide clear and prompt feedback on student work, and maintaining the course website.  Postdoctoral Scholars are also expected to attend bi-weekly course team meetings with other instructors of the course, and to attend bi-weekly faculty meetings. Postdocs are expected to teach up to 8 small sections (of approximately 15 students) per year as a Lecturer.  The total duration of an individual's postdoctoral service may not exceed five years, including postdoctoral service at other institutions.  The School of Information is interested in candidates who will contribute to diversity and equal opportunity in higher education through their teaching or other related areas. We require that applicants submit a statement addressing past and/or potential contributions.

We are cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

Ionosphere demonstrates local response to a geomagnetic storm superimposed on daily, seasonal and solar cycle dependent variabilities. These different phenomena make characterization of regional ionospheric dynamics a complex problem. New observational capabilities and sophisticated data analysis tools provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of ionosphere dynamics during storms as compared to quiet times. Specifically, the Total Electron Content (TEC) of the ionosphere is readily available from GPS measurements. Analysis of TEC dynamics over ground-based GPS sites using network analysis is of major interest. Characterizing network topology, connections between TEC measurements at different locations, directionality of the network can lead to better understanding of ionospheric dynamics and advances in space weather forecasting. We seek highly motivated candidates to participate in research on ionospheric dynamics and data analysis. We are particularly interested in candidates who will analyze satellite and ground-based observations to improve our understanding of space weather. Knowledge of basic signal processing techniques and system science approaches are encouraged.  References:  1. Verkhoglyadova, O. P., Komjathy, A., Mannucci, A.
