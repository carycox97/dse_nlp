We apply insights to the intersection of space, technology, and furniture, helping individuals and teams in leading companies around the world to be more successful at work. Steelcase pursues innovation, strives for sustainability and develop insights in every part of their business. Steelcase is the large global office furniture manufacturer with approximately 80 locations and 11,000 employees worldwide. It is headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which has been consistently named as one of US News’ top places to live in the US. The company designs and produces furniture, architectural products, textiles, wall surfaces, and ergonomic and technology tools for workspaces, education, and health care. About Operations   Analytics and   Strategy The Operations Analytics and Strategy team is a small team reporting to the VP, Operations Services. The Operations Analytics and Strategy is a new team at Steelcase created to support the specific strategic analytics needs of various Operations functions like Quality, Distribution, Engineering, Procurement. It is a cross-functional team which combines strategic and analytical capabilities with dedicated subject matter expertise sourced from Operations functions and the data engineering capabilities of our IT function. We work on operations problems which require translation of business challenges into analytic problems by data processing and analysis to improve business outcomes such as predictive maintenance, yield optimization problems, analytics supported decision making, or operations related customer satisfaction projects. What you will do As the Manager, Operations Analytics and Strategy you will be responsible for leading the team. This includes managing the day to day execution of the projects the team works on as well as setting the overall direction of the team and developing its capabilities.  For some projects you will be expected to guide a project from initial scoping all the way to the deployment into production of the solution created. For other projects you will serve as an internal analytics consultant and get involved at specific stages of the project when the work is sufficiently advanced. Throughout every project you will work closely with the subject matter experts embedded in the team, our data engineers, and related functions like the Advanced Analytics team to develop solutions that improve business outcomes in a dramatic way. This team generally works on a project basis to support key operational decisions. In some cases, you will directly lead the execution of projects, and in other cases you will support the team as they lead small project teams composed of Analysts and members assigned from partner functions. Whether you are leading a project directly or through a Manager you will be responsible for ensuring projects are: Set-up for success with a well scoped problem, a coherent problem-solving approach, a balanced workplan, and a good working and reporting cadence Solving the problem at a high cadence by focusing efforts on key analyses, and quickly iterating on and improving the answer Delivering high-quality answers in a timely fashion by creating communication materials that make complex problems easily accessible for senior decision-makers Support and when needed direct data wrangling efforts to ensure data is accurate and actionable.

You will work to provide practical answers to real problems with an outsized impact on our operations, and learn through practical experience what it takes to execute large-scale operational change at a global manufacturer. Occasional travel may be required but will likely be less than 10% of your time. What you bring The ideal candidate for this position has a strong command of a broad business consulting toolkit, including world-class problem solving, excellent communication skills, and the ability to quickly understand domain knowledge as needed. Beyond the basic consulting toolkit you must also be an outstanding people leader who is as comfortable helping manage and align senior executives across the organization as you are mentoring junior colleagues to quickly develop their capabilities.

Any applicable domain specific knowledge you might bring (e.g. machine learning) is a plus, but not required. You don’t need to be familiar with any specific data infrastructure tools we use at Steelcase, we expect you to pick-up those skills as needed. People Development   - You will be expected to be a people leader that inspires and develops others, leading teams to produce high impact work while maintaining a healthy balance, coaching and mentoring future generations of Steelcase leaders, and inspiring a broad followership Ownership / E ntrepreneurial   M indset  – The person in this role will have an outsized influence on the company’s operations and will require a strong ownership mentality who acts in the company’s best interest at all times. You will be expected to work not just on the COO’s top priorities, but also to help shape the company’s operating agenda. An entrepreneurial mindset that pushes the company to improve across all areas without waiting for direction will be key to your success To be successful in this role you will likely have some experience in roles that develop this skillset.
