https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=be3494d584aaa962&from=web&vjs=3,30,Research Engineer,Generally Intelligent,"San Francisco, CA","Summary We started Generally Intelligent because we believe that software with human-level intelligence will have a transformative impact on the world. We’re dedicated to ensuring that that impact is a positive one. We have enough funding to last for decades, and our backers include Y Combinator, researchers from OpenAI, Lightspeed, Threshold, and many others. This role is about creating software to support our scientific and engineering-driven approach to developing machines with human level intelligence. About the role You will run experiments in order to more deeply understand both the current solutions (e.g., what specific deep neural networks are learning) and the current problems (e.g., what about the training data makes it difficult to learn the patterns that seem so obvious to us). These experiments include changing the network architecture as well as the training data distribution (our data is mostly simulated). You will, in the course of running those experiments, spend most of your time creating reusable tools and systems required to actually run them and understand the results. Examples include visualizations for the data, changes to the simulator to create new data, and code for running large scale network architecture search across hundreds or thousands of containers. You will mostly pair program with other researchers and engineers. We find pair programming particularly useful because ML code needs a high level of correctness, and it’s helpful to have two minds working on a really hard problem. Plus it’s just more fun! You will participate in (our own unique version of) daily stand-ups, research planning, strategy discussions, paper clubs, learn-a-thons, and other activities designed to give us space to learn and plan and think. About you You are a software engineer who is passionate about understanding how the mind works. You want to build machines that truly understand the world in order to usher in a new era of abundance and flourishing for humanity. You do  not  need to have significant prior experience with machine learning (though it’s certainly a plus!) We’re very open to helping you learn to become a great machine learning engineer. We have done this for some current team members, and have a number of resources that make it very easy to get up-to-speed quickly. You  do  need to be a really good software engineer. Machine learning is 80%+ software engineering, so you should be very comfortable with Python. Other tools we use include PyTorch, docker, numpy, and wandb. About us We believe in working with the absolute best people in the world (which is why we pay top of market) We believe that there is something special about getting the most talented people together in one room, especially for research (which is why we’re fully in-person in SF) We believe that curiosity and personal growth are both extremely important (which is why you will have a $30K+ yearly budget for executive coaching, books, courses, conferences, etc) We believe that it is critical to not just attract great individuals, but build strong relationships between them (whichis why we have quarterly team off-sites, frequent team dinners, and other events) We believe in investing in resources so that you can work more effectively (which is why we have a $250K+ compute budget per person, dedicated contract engineers to support our researchers individually, why we’ve built internal tools to automate hyper-parameter optimization, etc) We believe in creating a culture of science and truth-seeking, where no idea is too crazy to consider and no ideas are considered holy (which is why we encourage questions in the middle of company-wide presentations and why we encourage the most junior members in a meeting to weigh in first) We also believe in creating a culture of psychological safety, where everyone feels able to voice their opinion without fear of judgment (which is why we have “Feelings Friday”, where we have space to share how we felt during the week, and why we have a culture manual with a bunch of small habits that help encourage safe, effective communication) We believe in having fun, and that being in a positive environment isn't just much more productive, it's just a better way to live (which is why we take Friday afternoons off together as a team, joke around, and join in each others’ hobbies, whether it’s D&D or hiking or meditation) We believe that creating software with human level intelligence comes with the responsibility to ensure that it benefits all of humanity, not just a select few (which is why we're creating a public benefit corporation, why we’re interested in safety research, and why we have internal working groups on safety). How to apply All submissions are reviewed by a person, so we encourage you to include a cover letter. If you have any work that you can showcase (open source code, a research paper, a side project, etc), you should certainly include it! We try to reply either way within a week or two at most (usually much sooner). We know that talent comes from many backgrounds, and with many different skills and preferences. That’s why we have a hiring process that gives you the ability to showcase yourself in a variety of different ways, depending on what feels best for you.

Our mission is to recognize, highlight and invest in the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of people in historically undervalued communities and partner with government and philanthropy to do the same. After working with thousands of families since our founding in 2001, at UpTogether, we are certain people don’t live in poverty because they are lazy, uneducated, or mismanage money, as stereotypes would indicate. Instead, the poverty cycle, which disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx communities, can be traced to well-intentioned but inadequate governmental and charitable policies and practices that rely on a traditional top-down approach. UpTogether’s Strengths Based Approach (SBA) includes:   Community : We center our work around the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.  Capital : We invest in our members with unrestricted cash in recognition of the initiatives they are taking to improve their lives.  Choice : We trust that people in undervalued communities know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.   UpTogether reveals and accelerates the initiative people are taking to improve their lives.  As a community, a movement, and a platform, we use the power of information—compelling insights and personal success stories—to transform stereotypes, beliefs, practices, and policies. Together with our members, we are championing a community-led movement to boost economic and social mobility in communities that have been undervalued and underinvested in for far too long. At UpTogether, we work toward these values:  Community : We honor the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.  Impact : We test and scale strategies for systems adoption of a strength-based approach to accelerate socioeconomic mobility for people living at or below the poverty line in the U.S.  Collaboration : We center the lived experiences of families in undervalued communities and engage the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of our board, partners, and staff to build and grow a strength-based approach to end poverty.  Racial Equity : We are committed to being an anti-racist organization, and we promote anti-racist policies that eliminate the racial wealth divide.  Leadership : We acknowledge that leadership is not based on a title and honor the many forms in which it appears. We celebrate leadership that embodies all of our organizational values, driving us to act against the dominating deficit-based approach to fighting poverty.  Choice : We trust that people living at or below the poverty line know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.  Job Description Content is king — Square merchants succeed when their content conveys the story and value of their products effectively. Yet the average merchant is not an expert in product photography, copywriting, SEO, or design. Furthermore, the average merchant has many existing sources of content available to them, but digitizing them to put them on an online store requires tedious manual effort. These factors hinder merchants from putting their best foot forward and starting selling online quickly. The Square Ecommerce ML team focuses on removing these frictions by using ML to help merchants import, manage, and improve their content. We have successful applications for some of these problems, but we're still discovering the best ways to accomplish this and the best applications for ML in this context. We're looking for a creative ML Engineer that is interested in building merchant-facing products, that is excited about finding novel ways of applying existing ML techniques to create exciting new products, and that is comfortable finding the right balance of algorithmic performance and simplicity to reduce time-to-market. You will: Work on deep learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) applications to improve document understanding, merchant site content, and merchant photography. Help procure, curate, and QA annotated data for new document parsing applications as well as for computer vision applications. Identify and use existing SOTA models, or build custom models based on SOTA approaches in NLP and CV, by reviewing the literature to identify best solutions to merchant problems. Work with product, design, and web/mobile engineering stakeholders to productionalize models into merchant-facing features by deploying them to services or mobile applications. In the long term, support or independently drive discovery of novel applications of ML to text and image content import, classification, and transformation.   Qualifications You Have: A Bachelor's degree with 2-3 years of experience in software development or a MSc/PhD with 0-2 years of experience. Already graduated or will be able to start working full-time in the next month. A strong modeling background, and experience building pipelines, modeling, and experimenting in frameworks like Keras or Pytorch. Experience training deep learning models for NLP applications or CV applications. If recently graduated, candidate should have thesis work or publications in these fields or closely related ones. Experience building services to serve ML applications in real-time, using technologies like Flask and MySQL. Working knowledge with cloud services like AWS, GCS, and their command line utilities. Experience working on ML projects end to end while collaborating with a variety of stakeholders. Preferred: Experience modifying SOTA deep learning architectures and experimenting with them to improve model performance. Demonstrated technical leadership and initiative in previous projects. Experience driving ML projects from beginning to end independently. The ability to convert open-ended product requirements into concrete ML solutions with a well-defined scope.
