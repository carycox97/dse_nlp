To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.  Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.

Working at Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by leveraging uncommonly impactful software – we hope you'll join us!  About the role  The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.   We are looking for an Applied Scientist to lead the R&D work at Afresh. You will take your existing knowledge of forecasting, simulation, and stochastic optimization and apply it to the challenging and important problem of perishable inventory control. You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core replenishment system. This will include modeling consumer demand, item-level perishability, and complex multi-echelon supply chains. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.  You will work on improving the core models of our system: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and simulation. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges. You will model the complex problems of inventory decay, promotions, price elasticity, and inventory uncertainty, and implement solutions to multi-stage and multi-echelon inventory optimization problems.  In your first 3 months, you will acquire an encyclopedic knowledge of perishable inventory control and Afresh's core decision making problem. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and simulation tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting, ordering, or simulation models.  By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our core modeling system.  By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core system and led research into new product areas (warehouse level replenishment, production planning).  We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.   Skills and experience The following represent attributes our ideal candidate possesses. We encourage all highly-qualified candidates to apply, even if they do not fulfill all the listed criteria.   5+ years of industrial or academic experience building systems that deal with large-scale decision making under uncertainty. Some possible prior research areas are inventory optimization, supply chain management, network optimization, forecasting, game theory, decision analysis, or stochastic and approximate dynamic programming.  Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English and easily translate business requirements into constrained optimization problems.  Ability to independently deliver high quality software implementations of your solutions in the Python data stack (numpy/torch/pandas/etc). Knowing Python before joining is not required.  PhD in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related quantitative field   About Afresh  Founded in 2017, Afresh is working on the #1 solution to curb climate change: reducing food waste. By combining human insight and transformative technology, we're helping grocers provide fresher food to customers at more affordable prices.

We've been onboarding some big clients and have the specific needs for the below specialist   for one of our clients.  BUDGET $75.00-$100.00/ hr   HOURS PER WEEK 40   STATUS Open   CONTRACT TYPE Long-term, ongoing project   SENIORITY Advanced   LOCATION Work from anywhere. Great English communication skills needed   TIME ZONE Eastern Standard Time (EST), Western Caribbean Partial overlap requested   About the Role  Our client is seeking a full-time machine learning software engineer as part of our collaboration with the Autonomous Learning Laboratory at UMass Amherst. As the lead developer on the project, this person will have significant independence and autonomy.  They've secured funding for this position for at least one year, which we believe will be enough time to implement the core functionality. Extensions will depend on our ability to secure more funding during the first year of work.  Purpose  Prof. Philip Thomas and his collaborators have designed a general and flexible framework for a new kind of machine learning algorithm called a Seldonian algorithm, which clarifies the three-way relationship between ML system designers, users, and the ML systems themselves. In particular, the Seldonian framework simplifies the problem of specifying and regulating undesirable behavior by involving end-users in the specification and oversight of system safety parameters. A high-level description of the Seldonian framework can be found here; the full Science paper can be found here.  We want to hire a software developer to create a software library that makes it easier for researchers and practitioners to apply and create Seldonian algorithms. This library would facilitate and advance academic research on safe machine learning and would provide a practical tool for corporations to responsibly apply machine learning to high-risk high-reward applications. The end goal is to get more safety constraints built into ML systems.  Responsibilities   Plan, design, and code a software library (or set of related libraries) that can be used by other software developers to more easily implement Seldonian algorithms in their projects.  Deeply familiarize yourself with the existing literature on Seldonian algorithms  Collaborate closely with Prof. Thomas and his collaborators on all aspects of the development process, from the discussion of high-level strategic goals (e.g. what programming language to use) to the design and implementation of individual library features   Qualifications   3-7 years of relevant experience  Deep knowledge of Python or C++ We expect the framework to be developed in Python or C++, and in either case to be callable from other common ML languages.  However we are open to using other languages, with a priority being placed on modularity and efficiency.  Broad familiarity with commonly-used machine learning algorithms  Experience leading and owning a software development project from beginning to end  Excellent technical communication skills, the ability to elaborate complex technical concepts and collaborate effectively with fellow engineers and researchersPrior research  or research engineering experience   Benefits   Become a world-leading expert on the practical implementation of Seldonian algorithms, encouraging the development and deployment of safer ML systems.  More independence and autonomy than you'd have at a big tech company  ABOUT THE HIRING PROCESS:  Qualified candidates will be invited to do a screening interview with the Braintrust staff.

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",30+ days ago,"6,041 reviews"

At the same time, there is a growing awareness of the significant safety, ethical, and societal challenges stemming from misuse and unintended consequences of AI systems. Risks related to artificial intelligence take many forms including privacy, security, safety, fairness, equity, explainability, polarization, disinformation, and the distribution of power. How we understand and manage these risks throughout the AI lifecycle will determine whether the full upside potential of these technologies can be realized and whether we can prevent significant and disproportionate harms. The Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) is seeking a creative and driven postdoctoral researcher for an Independent Postdoctoral Fellowship in Responsible AI. This researcher should bring a strong background in ethical and responsible practice in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in performing data-intensive research. The position requires the Fellow to create a research project that answers questions related to the ethical and responsible use and development of AI systems and machine learning technologies. Research topics might include (but are not limited to) automation and job displacement, algorithmic bias, explainable AI, and other concerns of inequality and distributive justice globally. We are especially interested in developing methods for evaluating AI systems with respect to emerging standards in government regulations about privacy, bias, fairness, and explainability. Ideally the work will have the potential to affect policy. The Data Science and Responsible AI Postdoctoral Fellowship is a full-time two-year position at BIDS. It is made possible by funding from Accenture Applied Intelligence. The Fellowship holder will be expected to produce novel research results communicated in academic publications and to lead a workshop or seminar series on the topic of the research; other possible contributions include open-source scientific software, curated datasets, and white papers and blog articles on data science and responsible AI. In defining and carrying out the independent, self-directed research project, the Fellow will work under the guidance and mentorship of an advisory team made up of BIDS Faculty Affiliates and research staff including Professor Rediet Abebe and Professor Stuart Russell (Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences), Professor Tolani Britton (Graduate School of Education) and Dr. Jessica Newman (AI Security Initiative). The position will also benefit from collaboration with Accenture Applied Intelligence. Accenture supports BIDS' research and educational objectives in data science with current foci on environment and energy, ethical AI, and social justice. The Fellow will be able to leverage this relationship to fully harness the data landscape and expertise available. In addition, as part of the BIDS research community, the Fellow will have the opportunity to learn from individuals engaged in research software development, computational reproducibility, and data-intensive research from a wide range of application domains.

The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher.  Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world's information and content free for everyone.  VideoAmp's mission is to create software and data solutions to enable advertisers to accurately measure and optimize their entire portfolio of linear TV, OTT, digital and walled garden investments while empowering publishers to effectively align and monetize their audiences with the advertiser's desired outcome in a consumer-first privacy paradigm.

We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance.
