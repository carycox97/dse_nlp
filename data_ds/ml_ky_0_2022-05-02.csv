https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=a4fd2f13e3a65be1&from=web&vjs=3,70,Customer Support Engineer,Accountable2You,"Williamstown, KY 41097","     We're growing and looking for our next Customer Support Engineer to join our team! Do you share our passion for accountability, love our core values, enjoy technology, and possess excellent written and spoken communication skills? Read on!        What’s the starting salary range?      Depending on your customer service and technical support experience, this full-time salaried role offers between $55,000 and $80,000 annually.        What makes the A2U support team different?      We're a support-driven company, which means everything we do at Accountable2You centers around growth through service to our customers. Most companies view customer support as a cost center, a leaky bucket that receives as few resources as possible.        At A2U, we believe that support-driven growth is a wholesome, ethical way to grow a company that centers around meeting needs. Customer Support is central to our business model, essential to our vision, and vital to our shared success.        What does a normal day look like?      As a Customer Support Engineer, you will need to master the deeper workings of our software as most of our work centers around things our customers encounter: Troubleshooting software issues on various device types, explaining our software and website, fixing billing problems, and training customers on best practices with our software. The constant advancements within Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, Apple iOS, and Chrome OS also allow us a wealth of technical topics to learn and master each day.        As a CS Engineer, you’ll also be expected to learn about our backend technology stack over time as you’ll frequently serve as the liaison between customer support and DevOps; you’ll want to know the fundamentals of our VPN servers, activity record ingestion, and API functions so you’ll become equipped to communicate with our product and DevOps teams regularly. While you won’t necessarily write our technical documentation, your expertise will be leaned upon heavily to review our customer-facing documentation for technical accuracy as we roll out software updates.        While you might not be a software developer, you’ll spend about 20% of your week in project-type troubleshooting tasks, using the various virtual machines you create and maintain to suit your test cases and isolate bugs in our production software.        Our Customer Support team handles incoming technical and account-related emails, chats, phone calls, social media messages and works together on improving our processes, customer documentation, and learning (and testing) our technology.        It’s important to note that while our support team is customer-facing, we don’t operate in a call center or a “sweatshop” dynamic. Customer Support spends a great deal of time designing processes, improving our customer-facing content, and documenting our technology. You’ll be expected to jump in alongside the other customer support team members when things are busy (60-80% of the week).        Our Customer Support team doesn't offer counseling services to our customers. Yet, we listen with compassion and empathy and then move forward with recommendations to better utilize our software in the customer's unique situation.        While many of our customers use our software to keep would-be temptations at bay and confirm their integrity, others struggle deeply with pornography and other addictive behaviors. As you help your team serve customers, you may encounter vulgar and offensive words – but we've intentionally prevented our software from capturing images or links to the objectionable content. We do our best to guard our team against objectionable content, and under no circumstances will you need to examine offensive websites or material.        About you          You’re an outstanding human . We get it, no one is perfect, yet you possess a strong moral character that loves our core values and affirms Accountable2You's mission and purpose.      You believe the struggle is real . You count bondage to pornography and other addictive behavior as serious matters. You’re committed to helping people in their journey toward life change.      You’re experienced in tech support . We’re looking for at least 3 years of experience in a technical support role (desktop support, system administration, network administration, etc.). Bonus points if written communication between you and your customers comprised over 50% of your interactions.      You’re a veteran with SaaS software and technology . We provide extensive training on our products, but you won’t need any training on the common software tool stack; you’ve been there and done that. If you haven’t used it before, you know how to find the answer and learn the tool because you do this all the time.      You’re a natural communicator . While you don’t need to be an extrovert, it does mean that those who know you best would say you thrive in environments that rely upon clear written and spoken communication. You’re always keen to learn new ways to use tone and voice in your customer interactions effectively. You know how to make a customer smile or deescalate a tense situation. You can document even the most confusing error or bug in an understandable and relatable way; both DevOps and customer support understand what you’re saying.      You’re a resourceful learner and a natural teacher . You’re naturally curious and love the art of “asking the better question” that reveals the actual need. You have a long list of techniques for navigating complex or confusing situations. You might not be a developer, but you’re resourceful: you know how to test your hypothesis, isolate bugs, and find answers. You're a gifted peer-mentor who can humbly guide your teammates as they handle challenging technical questions.      You’re highly empathetic and see things from the other person’s point of view . You know that everyone possesses unique skills and life experiences, so you default toward kindness and patience rather than critique and judgment. You make people feel empowered after interacting with you rather than stupid because of a knowledge gap or small mistake. Your teammates depend upon your ability to see the technical factors behind a problem.      You’re eager to grow personally and professionally . Like a world-class athlete working with a coach, you want to know what you did well and what you can do better next time. Excellence matters to you. At A2U, we all view feedback as the means to grow and improve toward excellence. That means we’re quick to learn from our mistakes and quick to extend grace to others amid their mistakes, too.      You’re persistent and love solving problems . There are few easy answers here, and this excites you. Every customer is a real person with bespoke needs and emotional predispositions. Likewise, every device is different and poses unique challenges. You don’t quit until you’ve done the hard work to research and answer the question at hand.      You love discovering a better way . Like us, you feel the adage, “faster is better” isn’t quite right. Instead, you believe that “better is faster,” so you’re always on the lookout for new efficiencies and a better way forward. Speed improves with efficiency and experience, and you’ve built a fair bit of both. You love building a process, seeking clarity, and creating unity through standardization.      You’re a flexible and proactive doer . You don’t wait for someone to tell you what to do next. You own your work, and you’re always looking for the next opportunity to meet a need, serve customers, or help your team. You see trends and rally your peers to take action. You know how to escalate critical matters to management or take the lead when it’s within your scope.                Requirements          A minimum of three years of experience in a technical support role, preferably in an IT department or DevOps team      A genuine delight in serving customers and meeting needs      Mastery in explaining complex concepts with a tone that reflects a kind, honest, and confident clarity      Experience with VPNs/networking, systems administration, software development, or end-point support (desktops, mobile, etc.)      Highly proficient in learning and testing new technologies (e.g., versions of Linux)      Expert troubleshooting: You know how to reproduce a bug and document your steps      Familiarity with virtual machines (Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels, VMWare, etc.)      Mastery of tools like Google Docs, Sheets, Zoom, Gmail, and other similar software      Experience using Zendesk, Help Scout, or other similar software      Experience using project/task management tools like Trello, Basecamp, Wrike, Asana, or other similar software      Refines, creates, and expands defined processes, pursuing clarity when the next steps are unclear      Quick learner who rapidly adapts to change      Affirmative, can-do attitude toward tasks and responsibilities      A team player who’s humble, hungry, and smart      Excellent attention to detail and a growth mindset (Tip: 1.25x playback speed )         Bonus points          Administration experience in Zendesk, Help Scout, or other similar software      Experience with payment platforms like Stripe, PayPal, etc.      Experience with technical writing or copywriting (support articles, blogs, etc.)      Experience with message platforms like Twilo, Plivo, etc.      Experience in project management, process modeling/flow charts, etc.      You're already using Accountable2You (or another similar accountability tool)                When and where do you work?      This role works standard business hours (Monday through Friday, 8 AM - 5 PM). This role is office-based in Williamstown, Kentucky, and is not eligible for remote work.        We recognize the best talent might not live within a commuting distance to our office. We offer a generous relocation package for US-based candidates outside the local area. If you’re our top candidate, we’ll help you move here!        Does this sound like a good fit?      We hire the best fit, but there’s a lot more that goes into “best fit” than a laundry list of previous experience.        If you love our mission, values, and model the humble, hungry, smart ethos we aim for at A2U, we encourage you to apply - we’d love to hear from you! We respond to all applicants, so you'll definitely hear back from us.        PLEASE NOTE:  Our emails to you may go to your spam/junk folder if your spam filter is overly aggressive.
