Look no further.   Plus One Robotics stands at the cusp of a new era in automated warehouses: our solutions are designed to alleviate labor shortages while improving throughput as consumer online spending continues to explode. Our robots are used by the biggest players in parcel shipping. If boxes have ever piled up outside your doorstep, thereâs a good chance our robots have touched at least one of them.   We seek a driven and intellectually voracious product manager who is equally comfortable with engineers and business executives to build out the platform undergirding our customer-facing products to accelerate the growth of the company.   The work will be challenging but itâll be a chapter of your career that will make for a great story.   About the Job   Essential Functions   For those who don't mind a steep learning curve, the right person for this role will enjoy wide latitude and broad scope:   Milestone delivery:   Manage the multi-team development of a robotic platform by understanding business requirements, anticipating bottlenecks and dependencies, managing changes, removing roadblocks, mitigating risks, and building consensus with cross-functional stakeholders. Roadmap design:   Identify, prioritize, and advocate for the most impactful opportunities to improve the efficiency and quality of longer-term customer-facing product development. Data-driven decisions:   Define and assess metrics to guide platform development. Engineering translation:   Collaborate with engineers and customer-facing product managers to write technical requirements docs to help engineers understand product specifications. Foundation building:   Make tradeoffs between satisfying near-term needs while building a platform that can support growth at scale across many applications.   Qualifications   Qualifications   Our customers will learn about how best to incorporate new technology into their physical spaces while deriving immediate concrete value from their purchase of the robot. You will pull out all the stops to ensure the success of our customers â some of the most prominent brands in the country â and use their feedback to further improve our product.   Youâre the ideal candidate if:  Youâre responsive and responsible:   you commit to deadlines and err on the side of over-communication. Youâre analytical and data-driven:   p-values and pivot tables are old buddies with whom you donât mind spending an afternoon distilling data into an insightful story. Youâre versatile and goal-oriented:   you can drive various teams with competing priorities. Youâre collaborative and results-oriented:   you understand both that you need to crack a few eggs to make an omelet but also that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. You have an eye for detail and are an excellent writer:   you notice when someone writes âPick Oneâ instead of âPickOneâ and it bothers you when others donât get it right. You're self-sufficient and whip-smart:   you get things done and learn what you donât know. Youâre organized:   you can juggle and make progress on multiple initiatives simultaneously. Youâre empathetic and user-focused:   you understand that you may not be the target audience and you are unrelenting in holding a high bar for the user experience. Youâre creative and a strategic thinker:   you understand and can shape the team around the right level of process while displaying excellent judgment to achieve both short-term and long-term goals. You value first-hand on-the-ground experience and not just taking someone elseâs word for it: youâre happy to observe and take notes on the robot picking up packages all day and jump on a plane as needed to fully internalize customer workflows. Youâre a technophile:   you donât have to be a former engineer, but youâve dabbled in code and are eager to brush up your experience in unfamiliar fields, whether itâs hardware, perception, machine learning, or others. Youâre high-integrity, ambitious, and play âinfiniteâ games:   you understand that careers are long, that people and values come first, and that there's a difference between being liked and being respected. Youâre passionate and clear-eyed when it comes to robots:   you understand that thereâs a gap between technological reality and media-driven expectations and are excited about the opportunity to move the industry forward by whatever means necessary, even if it isnât glamorous.   Desired Education and Experience   Even if you donât check all the boxes, feel free to include a short paragraph explaining why you would be the best candidate regardless.   Bachelor's degree in a technical field (e.g. computer science, engineering, physics, math, etc.) or equivalent practical experience 5 years of experience in product management, especially in enterprise platforms or robotics Experience in one or more of the following:   cloud infrastructure, on-prem enterprise software, machine learning, developer APIs, warehouse logistics Working knowledge of best practices in Agile, engineering processes, and preparing a startup for growth   Additional Eligibility Qualifications   Must have a valid passport.
