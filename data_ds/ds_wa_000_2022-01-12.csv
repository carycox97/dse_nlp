Organizations have used data to keep track of ‘business as usual’ for years, and to understand trends in a wide variety of metrics, such as revenue, web page views, daily active users, churn rate, transaction volume, mobile app installations, memory consumption, CPU performance, and more. While these data trends do provide a big picture of the business, understanding changes from the ‘business as usual’ is equally important, as these changes could indicate a burgeoning problem (e.g., an unexpected decrease in sales, a suspicious network traffic), or an opportunity (e.g., an unanticipated customer lead). These changes manifest themselves as outliers in the data. Detecting these outliers and acting on them quickly, helps you stay on top of the needs of your business, and provide a reliable customer experience. In this role, you will be working on trend setting technologies in the machine learning and AI field. This is an area that requires solving the hardest engineering challenges to enable machine learning powered solutions for our customers. As a tier zero Amazon service our solutions have to be scalable, efficient, and extremely fault tolerant. Experience with machine learning systems is not required. You will deliver some of our most strategic technical projects, deliver large scalable systems, design new software systems at the cutting edge of distributed database technology and have a significant bottom-line impact on our business and competitive position. In addition to delivering critical software, you will draw from a deep and broad technical expertise to mentor engineers and provide leadership on complex technical issues. This position within the AWS AI team presents a unique and rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor within a fast growing business and help shape the technology, product and the business. A successful candidate will bring deep technical and software expertise, desire to have an industry wide impact and ability to work within a fast moving, startup environment in a large company to rapidly deliver services that have a broad business impact.

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will be carried out by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is the flagship ground-based astronomical survey of the 2020s. With an estimated start date in 2024, LSST will generate the deepest-ever, multi-color, 10-year-long movie of the southern sky, detecting 30 billion stars and galaxies and amassing 100 PB of imaging and catalog data. Science is at an inflection point where the volume of data and the software infrastructure we use to analyze it can fundamentally change our understanding of the universe. The scientific reach of the LSST will be extraordinary, addressing questions such as: how did the Solar System form; what governs the birth and death of stars; how does dark matter sculpt the shape of our Galaxy; will an asteroid devastate the Earth in the next century; what is the nature of the dark energy that drives the expansion of our Universe?
