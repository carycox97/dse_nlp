More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of computing. With the GPU acting as the primary computing device, robots can now perceive and understand the world around them. Today, NVIDIA has transformed into “the AI computing company.” We're looking to grow our company, and build our teams with the smartest people in the world working on diverse aspects of AI. Join us at the frontier of technological advancement!        Robotics is an increasingly exciting field, influenced heavily by recent advances in hardware acceleration through devices such as the modern GPU. These advances have enabled tremendous progress in several areas of robotics, including manipulation, visual recognition, real-time tracking, and learning-based control. Robots are getting increasingly proficient at building 3D maps of their environments, detecting and tracking objects and people as they move through the world, learning controllers from realistic simulation, and understanding commands provided via gestures and natural language.        What you'll be doing:     While our ultimate goal is to reach human-level dexterity, perception, and adaptability, we still have a long way to go. To enable the next generation of robots that can robustly operate in the physical world and interact with people in a natural way, progress is still needed in multiple domains: perception, planning, learning, and control. Moreover, even more importantly, the integration of these individual contributions into complete robot systems opens new challenges.        Toward this goal, the NVIDIA Robotics Research Lab brings together a diverse, interdisciplinary research team working on core robotics topics ranging from control, perception, machine learning, common sense reasoning, task planning, human-robot collaboration, and critical related areas such as deep learning for computer vision, natural language processing and decision making.        The lab focuses on fundamental research questions in robotics and lab members are encouraged to publish their research and open source their code. The lab hosts numerous internships every year to foster education and communication, and the team is encouraged to collaborate broadly with institutions outside of NVIDIA, both academic and industrial. NVIDIA is well known for its team culture, and lab researchers are able to closely interact with others within the company who are experts in broad subtopics such as computer vision, computer graphics, GPU computing, AI and Deep Learning, self-driving cars, and physics-based simulation.        The following research areas are of particular interest:     Robot manipulation, robot control, reinforcement learning, computer vision, human-robot interaction, deep learning, physics-based simulation, neuro symbolic reasoning, and natural language processing.     What we need to see:         Pursuing PhD in Robotics, Computer Science, Engineering or related field.      3+ years of relevant research or work experience      Knowledge of theory and practice of robotics, or a related area with a strong interest in connecting your work to robotics scenarios.      A track record of research excellence with your work published in top conferences and journals such as Robotics (RSS, ICRA, IROS, CoRL, T-RO, IJRR), Machine Learning (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, JMLR), Computer Vision (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI) and Language (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL).      Exceptional programming skills in Python, and deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow and Pytorch. Fluency in C/C++; CUDA and robotics frameworks such as ROS is a plus.      Strong communication and interpersonal skills are required along with the ability to work in a dynamic, research focused team. A demonstrated history of mentoring junior engineers and interns is a huge plus.           Are you dedicated, upbeat and dynamic with excellent analytical ability? Are you a researcher or an engineer passionate and highly motivated about solving complex problems? If so, you may be a perfect fit for NVIDIA!
