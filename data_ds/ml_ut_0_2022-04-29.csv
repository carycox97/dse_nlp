A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed. We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas. Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you. Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. * Life at Builder* It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ecab9313c4c4d8df&from=web&vjs=3,50,"Associate Director, Assay Development",Recursion,"Salt Lake City, UT 84108","Your work will change lives. Including your own.  Eight years ago, Recursion was staining plates by hand. Today, we've created a library of more than one billion cellular images on the basis of a radically different approach to biotech. This is a bold approach that we believe will reinvent drug discovery and development.  Recursion is the clinical-stage biotechnology company industrializing drug discovery by decoding biology. Recursion leverages sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to distill from its dataset the Recursion Map, a collection of hundreds of billions of searchable inferences across biology and chemistry unconstrained by human bias.  If you draw a line from eight years ago to today, you'll see our trajectory and understand that Recursion is a very different kind of company. You cannot make these kinds of leaps simply by adding incubators, fluorescent microscopes, and robots to automate processes at scale. Our drug discovery strategies are map and data-driven rather than target-driven, revealing destinations you might never have considered.  While we offer cutting-edge tools and an amazing lab, the secret sauce is our people. Everyday you'll face a challenge you've literally never seen before. But you'll be surrounded by humble experts who will happily drop everything to support you, get exposure to a wide range of ideas and approaches, and be asked to think beyond the obvious to solve those challenges. Our organization structure and culture isn't driven by politics or ego, it is designed first and foremost to help you do your best work.  You'll be joining Recursion at an interesting time, both for the company and for the world. The global pandemic has reinforced in everyone's mind not only the importance of therapeutics, but also the critical value that accelerating every phase of drug discovery and development can provide. For most, the notion that ""patients can't wait"" is abstract; COVID-19 has made this concept all too real for millions, even billions, worldwide. As the Associate Director, Assay Development, you'll be in a position to directly accelerate the timeline of getting drugs into the hands of patients who need them.  The Impact You'll Make   Lead -  Apply your knowledge and industry experience to guide a team that builds the disease models and assays necessary to inform on the efficacy and activity of our treatment candidates  Mentor -  Utilize your management experience and growth mindset to develop the associates, scientists, and other teammates into the professionals they want to be  Influence -  Get your recommendations and proposals for the technologies, assays, and model systems adopted by the teams at Recursion and watch your ideas drive our discovery programs forward at a faster pace  Collaborate  - Work in a cross-functional matrix organization with translational biologists, chemists, data scientists, commercial and business development representatives, and software engineers to deliver the data necessary to move our programs forward   The Teams You'll Join  With treatments for hundreds of diseases in our sights, we have many teams you will be joining.

Rather than make a prediction on one or two products or indications, what if you could build a biological map that supports dozens or hundreds of indications? Every week at Recursion, we run more than a million experiments creating a library of more than one billion cellular images on the basis of that radically different approach to biotech. This is a revolutionary approach that we believe will reinvent drug discovery and development.  Recursion is the clinical-stage biotechnology company industrializing drug discovery by decoding biology. Recursion leverages sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to infer biological relationships. By commanding massive experimental scale — up to millions of wet lab experiments weekly — and massive computational scale — owning and operating one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, Recursion is uniting technology, biology and chemistry to advance the future of medicine.  In the last eight years, what we've learned is that curing many human diseases takes more than sheer brains and ambition. It requires a willingness for people to push themselves and each other out of their comfort zones and kicking big ideas around with people far outside their ""silo."" We encourage biologists to sit with data scientists and clinical scientists and think beyond what already exists, to be willing to engage with new thinking and have deeper conversations about what could be. Every day we learn from and influence each other. Occasionally, we inspire one another.  To balance the push/pull of creative friction, we share the responsibility of caring for each other. We want to do our best work and invent the future together without conflict or eroding away our spirit. The idea that we care — for our patients, for our work and for each other is one of our core values. Alongside our other values of delivering, being bold with integrity, learning, and working as One Recursion, we have built a culture that lets people work at their best, sprinting towards new ideas knowing that there will be time for recovery. These values are more than posters and taglines. They are the concepts we discuss and question regularly because we work and live by them every single day.  The Impact You'll Make   Apply  your skills and knowledge of genetic engineering and cell based assay development to develop the next technology to be implemented on Recursions Phenomics platform  Scientific Lead  on numerous scientific projects where you'll guide the da- to-day, week-to-week activities in the Map Perturbation group with direct impact on company value creation  Provide  scientific guidance and career development to research associates and scientists  Collaborate  with individuals in Data Science, Engineering, Process Development to drive projects forward   The Team You'll Join  Reporting to the Director, System Biology, you will join the Systems Biology group that is focused on leveraging all available genetic engineering tools and approaches to create large data sets fit for machine learning. Your work will directly expand Recursion's ability to screen, develop, and validate treatments for human disease. This will require you to apply your expertise in genetic engineering to develop novel cell based assay approaches suitable for large scale experimentation and automation. You will be supported in your work by a core group of Biologists and Data Scientists. You will also collaborate   cross functionally with other biologists, data scientists, engineers, cell culture experts, automation experts, and product managers and learn new skill sets in a matrixed company.  The Experience You'll Need:   4+ years work experience in pharma or biotech industry required  Advanced degree (MS / PhD) degree in Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, Genetics, or related Life Science field  Experience independently driving projects from the bench  Experience leading cross-functional teams in a dynamic environment  Experience providing scientific guidance and career development to direct reports  Experience implementing CRISPR-Cas9 to manipulate the genome of human cell culture (preferably at scale) and experience with CRISPRa, CRISPRi, and other variants.  Experience leading cell based assay development, including culturing human primary, immortalized, and cancer cell lines  Experience with high content imaging, automation, and high throughput screening  Clear record of skills in writing, communication, and formulation of scientific arguments  Familiarity with data analysis and graphing software, such as, Cell Profiler, ImageJ, Graphpad Prism, or Spotfire. Familiarity with Microsoft Suite, Google Apps, Lucid, and other organization and communication tools.   Nice to have Experience:   Experience with other genetic manipulation techniques - TALENs, siRNA, etc.'  Experience with viral delivery of reagents to human cell culture  Experience gene editing in human neuronal cell types  Coding skills in python and/or other languages   #LI-LM1 The Values That We Hope You Share:   We Care:  We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.  We Learn:  Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.  We Deliver:  We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.  Act Boldly with Integrity:  No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.  We are One Recursion:  We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.   Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren't static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here.  Recursion requires all employees to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to their first date of employment.  More About Recursion  Central to our mission is the Recursion Operating System, or Recursion OS, that combines an advanced infrastructure layer to generate what we believe is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing proprietary biological and chemical datasets and the Recursion Map, a suite of custom software, algorithms, and machine learning tools that we use to explore foundational biology unconstrained by human bias and navigate to new biological insights which may accelerate our programs.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=34a65d781f94424f&from=web&vjs=3,140,Full Stack Software Engineer,Recursion,"Salt Lake City, UT 84108","Working here could change what you want from a job  If you made a list of all the things your perfect job would have, what would be on it? Would it include a mission that truly justified the word ""mission?"" Would it involve being part of one of the best scientific research and production labs in the world creating petabytes of insight-rich data? Would it be a place filled with smart people all trying to help you do the best work of your career? Would it have leadership that could see an almost science fiction-like future and was looking to you to get there?  Recursion is the clinical-stage biotechnology company industrializing drug discovery by decoding biology. Recursion leverages sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to distill from its dataset the Recursion Map, a collection of hundreds of billions of searchable inferences across biology and chemistry unconstrained by human bias. Recursion has been purpose-built to do things that have quite literally never been done before. And while we have resources and an amazing lab, the secret sauce is our people. They are the ones who make big bets and deal in orders of magnitude instead of thinking incrementally, and the result is clear: Eight years ago, we were doing plate manufacturing by hand. Today, we are able to process and scan more than a million experiments every week.  You'll be joining Recursion at an interesting time, both for the company and for the world. The global pandemic has reinforced in everyone's mind not only the importance of therapeutics, but also the critical value that accelerating every phase of drug discovery can provide. For most, the notion that ""patients can't wait"" is abstract; COVID-19 has made this concept all too real for millions, even billions, worldwide. Every week, you'll work hand-in-glove with our data and science teams, turning 1.8 million+ weekly automated experiments into a map of human biology.  It is an audacious goal, but it isn't a dream or science fiction. We're already doing it.   The Impact You'll Make  This is a role for those who collaborate well with experts from both engineering and other departments in order to boldly deliver solutions that allow us to execute on our vision to decode biology to radically improve lives.   Build a map of biology.  Leveraging the power of deep learning models created by our in-house data scientists, you'll enable scientists to explore a map of biology that infers relationships between diseases and treatments, guiding them quickly towards potential treatments that can then be validated in the lab.  Create highly usable interfaces meeting user workflow needs.  Our tools need to help scientists generate disease treatment hypotheses without getting in the way. We partner with scientists to understand their workflows and build and refine the way they interact with data, enabling them to work as efficiently as possible.  Streamline data processing pipelines.  New experiment data from our wet labs is constantly added to a large data set that sits at the heart of our applications. You will play a role in building and refining the pipelines that get this data from the lab to our apps automatically, and in ensuring that the data can be accessed efficiently by not only our own apps, but also by our team of data scientists for running ad-hoc analyses.   Every Recursion engineer acts as a mentor, coach, and sponsor.  You will share your technical knowledge and experiences, resulting in an increase in learning, growth, and impact within and beyond your team.  The Team You'll Join  Engineering is the glue at Recursion that ties everything together. From web applications for tracking reagent details and inventory, to designing and executing experiments, to real-time image compositing, to distilling and visualizing high-dimensional data, our efforts are focused on enabling scientists to quickly and confidently find cures and treatments. In doing this work you will collaborate with biologists, chemists, and data scientists to build the right tools and iterate on making the entire process quicker, easier, more reliable, and more intuitive.  You'll be moving through a full stack of software spanning user interfaces with behavior-based and user-centered designs, RESTful APIs, event streaming, and third-party integrations - seeking and providing feedback and making trade offs as you go to get to the right solution with the right amount of effort.  The Experience You'll Need   Excitement to learn parts of our tech stack that you might not already know. Our current tech stack primarily consists of Python, JavaScript (React), PostgreSQL, and Kafka, deployed to Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform.  Experience collaborating to complete large projects. We don't have much in the way of project managers.  A people-first mindset. Despite the deadlines, we always prioritize supporting our coworkers in their growth and experience.  Adapt your workflow to include or improve your skills in writing tests for your code and automating deployments, logging, metrics collection, and monitoring.  Biology or chemistry background is not necessary, but intellectual curiosity is a must!   #LI-BW1 The Values That We Hope You Share:   We Care:  We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.  We Learn:  Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.  We Deliver:  We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.  Act Boldly with Integrity:  No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.  We are One Recursion:  We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.   Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=5aed9d3335c97626&from=web&vjs=3,220,"Senior Director of Data Science, Drug Discovery",Recursion,"Salt Lake City, UT 84108","Data science is the backbone of our drug discovery pipeline. Not an afterthought.  Recursion is the clinical-stage biotechnology company industrializing drug discovery by decoding biology. Recursion leverages sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to distill from its dataset the Recursion Map, a collection of hundreds of billions of searchable inferences across biology and chemistry unconstrained by human bias.  Recursion's creed - to build a map of biology and follow this map to discover treatments to serve patients - relies on our unique combination of high-throughput and high-dimensional biological experimentation with deep computational modeling to discover therapeutic starting points and rapidly progress them to the clinic.  The Recursion Map of Biology is a unique platform integrating genome-scale reverse genetics and chemical profiling - with over 1 million unique biological perturbations profiled - in a high-dimensional, uniform biological assay to predict tens of billions of relationships between biological perturbations and therapeutic candidates. The Senior Director, Drug Discovery position offers a unique opportunity to develop, guide, and implement the strategy to weave computation through the drug discovery process, from program ideation and initial hit selection in the Recursion Map, through molecular optimization, and culminating in transition to IND-enabling studies.  The Impact You'll Make  In this role, you, your team, and your colleagues will:   Develop  Recursion's computational roadmap for search of our chemical-genetic Maps to identify efficacious starting points against both monogenic and complex disease; for target and mechanism-of-action deconvolution and chemical optimization in our high-dimensional phenotypic space; and for biomarker discovery to rapidly transition molecules to the clinic.  Manage and Guide  teams in executing the above strategy to turn maps into medicines.  Collaborate  with other leaders in discovery biology, chemistry, and data science to deliver therapeutic programs to the clinic and to industrialize the process of doing so with machine-learning driven optimization of each stage.   This is a drug discovery-focused role and candidates are expected to be experienced in industrial drug discovery specifically. Experience in clinical development, post-marketing data science, or data analytics and infrastructure are valuable but not independently qualifying.  The Team You'll Join  As Senior Director of Data Science, Drug Discovery, you will report to the VP, Data Science and lead our computational drug discovery efforts. You will collaborate with peer leaders in data science, biology, chemistry, and engineering to drive both present execution and future industrialization in both Recursion's core therapeutic areas of oncology, neuroscience, fibrosis and future areas. You will lead teams focused in each therapeutic area, as well as application-focused teams bringing together innovations across therapeutic areas in service of Recursions high-level goals and long-term vision.  The Experience You'll Need   7+ years applying professional competencies to fundamental problems of relevance to drug discovery, specifically in a biopharma industry setting.  Experience as a member or leader on multiple active discovery/preclinical candidate program teams, collaborating with leads in biology and chemistry.  Experience hiring, managing, and mentoring teams engaged in drug discovery activities in a matrixed environment.  A vision for transforming drug discovery, from target/model identification through screening, hit to lead, and lead-optimization with the use of computational modeling and machine learning.  Curiosity and the professional skill-set to excel in an open, highly collaborative, and growth-oriented environment.   #LI-EP1 The Values That We Hope You Share:   We Care:  We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.  We Learn:  Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.  We Deliver:  We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.  Act Boldly with Integrity:  No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.  We are One Recursion:  We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.   Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren't static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work.

More About Recursion  Central to our mission is the Recursion Operating System, or Recursion OS, that combines an advanced infrastructure layer to generate what we believe is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing proprietary biological and chemical datasets and the Recursion Map, a suite of custom software, algorithms, and machine learning tools that we use to explore foundational biology unconstrained by human bias and navigate to new biological insights which may accelerate our programs.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=fd27fe1098b94b20&from=web&vjs=3,220,Vice President of High Throughput Operations,Recursion,"Salt Lake City, UT 84108","Your work will change lives. Including your own.  Recursion is the clinical-stage biotechnology company industrializing drug discovery by decoding biology. Recursion leverages sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to distill from its dataset the Recursion Map, a collection of hundreds of billions of searchable inferences across biology and chemistry unconstrained by human bias. Eight years ago, we were staining plates by hand. Today, we've created a library of more than one billion cellular images on the basis of a radically different approach to biotech. This is a bold approach that we believe will reinvent drug discovery and development.  If you draw a line from eight years ago to today, you'll see our trajectory and understand that Recursion is a very different kind of company. You cannot make these kinds of leaps simply by adding incubators, fluorescent microscopes, and robots to automate processes at scale. Our drug discovery strategies are map and data-driven rather than target-driven, revealing destinations you might never have considered. And for them to succeed, they require an unconstrained thinker to oversee our high-throughput screening operation.  While we offer cutting-edge tools and an amazing lab, the secret sauce is our people. Everyday you'll face a challenge you've literally never seen before. But you'll be surrounded by humble experts who will happily drop everything to support you, get exposure to a wide range of ideas and approaches, and be asked to think beyond the obvious to solve those challenges. Our organization structure and culture isn't driven by politics or ego, it is designed first and foremost to help you do your best work.  You'll be joining Recursion at an interesting time, both for the company and for the world. The global pandemic has reinforced in everyone's mind not only the importance of therapeutics, but also the critical value that accelerating every phase of drug discovery and development can provide. For most, the notion that ""patients can't wait"" is abstract; COVID-19 has made this concept all too real for millions, even billions, worldwide. As the Vice President of High Throughput Operations, you'll be in a position to directly accelerate the timeline of getting drugs into the hands of patients who need them.  The Impact You'll Make  You are a key value driver for Recursion as the leader of our high throughput operations across multiple -omics platforms. Specifically, you will have oversight of the compound management, cell culture, phenomics high throughput operations and multi-omics operations teams. In this role, you will   Innovate  in the areas of technology, automation and new scientific approaches to modeling complex biology, human disease and chemical drug development  Deliver  high quality biological and chemical data at an unprecedented scale  Partner  with other senior leaders across technology, science and accelerating functions to deliver on our company mission and strategy  Inspirational leadership  for teams delivering at the intersection of operational excellence and cutting edge science & technology   The Team You'll Join  You will be a senior leader at Recursion, joining a high performing and mission-focused team while leading High Throughput Operations and reporting to the COO. This is a dynamic group of people who are tenacious in scientific problem solving and are rigorous in challenging the status quo. We love delivering against ambitious challenges and we do so in a collaborative environment. The team has achieved unprecedented scale in recent years and you will lead the organization to the next level of technical innovation and operational rigor.  The Experience You'll Need   Demonstrated ability to lead and influence as a senior leader in a fast paced, innovative organization. Prior experience as an executive in a biotechnology, healthcare or life science technology platform company is highly desirable  A background in Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, or related field and >10 years of experience working across multiple relevant functions, including systems engineering, high throughput laboratory automation, process development, research core operations, research biology and/or drug discovery  Proven experience running and scaling high throughput laboratory operations, direct experience in next-generation sequencing, phenomics high throughput screening, cell culture and/or compound management highly desirable  Demonstrated ability to align on the tactics and strategies needed for successful operations, influence cross-functionally, and promote accountability in a positive and efficacious manner  The ability to translate an innovative technology vision into operational reality  Experience developing and implementing efficient and effective operational strategies  Proven leader with experience recruiting and managing high-performing teams and a reputation for maximizing and growing talent  Proven leader with experience influencing at an executive level and translating high level vision and strategy into action across a multi-discipline, multi-layer matrixed organization  Excellent organizational, planning, and analytical skills  Bachelor's degree in a scientific or engineering discipline, a graduate degree is desirable   #LI-CP1 The Values That We Hope You Share:   We Care:  We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.  We Learn:  Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.  We Deliver:  We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.  Act Boldly with Integrity:  No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.  We are One Recursion:  We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.   Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren't static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here.  Recursion requires all employees to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to their first date of employment.  More About Recursion  Central to our mission is the Recursion Operating System, or Recursion OS, that combines an advanced infrastructure layer to generate what we believe is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing proprietary biological and chemical datasets and the Recursion Map, a suite of custom software, algorithms, and machine learning tools that we use to explore foundational biology unconstrained by human bias and navigate to new biological insights which may accelerate our programs. We are a biotechnology company scaling more like a technology company. Recursion is proudly headquartered in Salt Lake City.  Learn more at www.recursion.com, or connect on Twitter and LinkedIn.
