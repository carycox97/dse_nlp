The type of problems we solve at SIG are often different from the subject of your PhD thesis, but nonetheless, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding. The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea: This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria. As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming. Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal. You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production. Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance. As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas. Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.  What we're looking for  PhD degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably Experience working on in-depth research projects Finance experience is a plus, but not required By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Strategist position.

Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science (SCS) is widely recognized as one of the first and the best computer science programs in the world. Our programs train the next generation of innovators to take real-world problems and improve the way people live and work. Headquartered at Carnegie Mellon University, the Delphi research group was founded in 2012 to advance the theory and practice of epidemic forecasting. Pre-pandemic our focus was seasonal influenza; now it's COVID. Currently our focus is on developing and maintaining COVIDcast , which provides the nation's largest repository of diverse, geographically-detailed, real-time indicators of COVID activity. We work on the full data pipeline: several of the underlying data sources (on which these indicators are built) would not exist or be publicly available without our efforts; and on the other end, we use these indicators to power our nowcasting and forecasting models. COVIDcast is used regularly by public health officials, government agencies, data journalists, healthcare companies, financial firms, and fellow modelers. We work closely with the CDC, and are currently a CDC Center of Excellence for Forecasting (one of two nationally). We are looking for a talented engineer to prevent, identify, diagnose, and rectify problems or outages that occur in the data processing pipelines for our indicators. This person will ideally have competency in linux systems administration, basic database & script programming, data analysis, and software engineering in a team setting. This is a combination of site reliability, operations, system administration, and light project management work. We currently run 12 individual indicator pipelines for tracking COVID, producing nearly 200 distinct time series. We're on schedule to exceed 2B data points over the summer, and plan to massively expand our coverage to include influenza in the coming months. Our job scheduling system was developed in-house, but for monitoring we use Elastic/Kibana and NewRelic. You do not need to have specific experience with either to apply. Core responsibilities will include: Maintain indicator uptime and correctness Monitor system output Identify the cause of any runtime errors, and either make repairs directly or recommend alternate solutions Respond to bug reports from data users Monitor our data sources for any changes in formatting or data collection policy, and either make the necessary adjustments to our code, or flag for review Monitor system performance, and flag any trends that may jeopardize future uptime Design, implement, and deploy changes or systems that will scale with dramatic (10x) increases to the data we process daily Reduce maintenance effort Improve fault response time Decrease opportunities for human error Flexibility, excellence, and passion are vital qualities within the School of Computer Science. Inclusion, collaboration and cultural sensitivity are valued competencies at CMU. Therefore, we are in search of a team member who is able to effectively interact with a varied population of internal and external partners at a high level of integrity. We are looking for someone who shares our values and who will support the mission of the university through their work. Qualifications: Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, Information Systems or related field required. Minimum of 1 year of related experience required. Basic linux system administration: system layout, file permissions, utilities (syslog, cron), diagnostic tools (ps, htop, grep) Basic database use: mysql, mysqldump Rough script programming (Python, bash) Software development in a team setting (Python certainly; R if you have it) Data analysis: Diagnosing and fixing runtime errors and logic bugs Performing basic growth projections to predict future problems Communicating results Requirements: Successful background check CMU’s COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements:  As a condition of employment, Carnegie Mellon University requires all staff and faculty working in the United States to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

What you'll do:   Develop spatiotemporal machine learning models that capture behavior and state of scenes.  Read the literature, look at raw data, design state-of-the-art solutions, and productize them all the way from lab through to the test track, and ultimately bring them to public roads.  Act as a force multiplier across the team: use your experience to provide a voice of reason and knowledge, and identify opportunities for improvements that scale the engineering team further.  Build relationships with upstream and downstream partners and work cross-functionally to deliver high-impact features that improve our perception system.   What you'll need to succeed:   Degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related field.  Expert-level machine learning knowledge and experience, with a successful track record of developing and deploying deep learning solutions using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar.  Experience with camera-based systems and computer vision.  Experience shipping computer vision software products to industry or consumers.   Nice to haves:   Ph.D. with machine learning focus, or equivalent experience.  Experience developing and deploying temporal computer vision models (for instance, video activity recognition or using multiple frames for improved results on other tasks).   What we offer you:   High-quality individual and family medical, dental, and vision insurance  Competitive compensation packages  Employer-matched 401(k) retirement plan with immediate vesting  Employer-paid group term life insurance and the option to elect voluntary life insurance  Paid parental leave  Paid medical leave  Unlimited vacation  Complimentary daily lunches, beverages, and snacks  Pre-tax commuter benefits  Monthly wellness stipend  Professional development reimbursement  Employee assistance program  Discounted programs that include legal services, identity theft protection, pet insurance, and more  Company and team bonding outlets: employee resource groups, quarterly team activity stipend, and wellness initiatives   Our Background:  Argo AI was founded in late 2016 by industry experts with extensive experience building robotic systems for commercial applications. Our once-small team has since grown into an over 1,000-person strong company with strategic partnerships with two of the world's leading automakers: Ford and Volkswagen. Our self-driving system is the first with commercial deployment plans for Europe and the U.S., and thanks to an ability to tap into both automakers' global reach, our technology platform has the largest geographic deployment potential of any self-driving technology to date.  At Argo AI, we believe that embracing differences delivers superior results.

If that signal produces profitable results, you will work side-by-side with technologists and put it into production. Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will actively monitor its real-time performance in the financial markets. As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas. Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.
