Sellers are a critical part of Amazon’s ecosystem to deliver on our vision of offering the Earth’s largest selection and lowest prices. In this ecosystem, the International Seller Services org (ISS) plays a critical role in enabling Sellers across EU5, China, Japan, Australia, Brazil and Turkey to make their Selection available to customers globally and deliver the experience they have come to expect from Amazon.        In Jeff’s own words (2019 Q1 shareholders letter):  “Something strange and remarkable has happened over the last 20 years. Take a look at these numbers: 1999 3% …… 2018 58%. The % represent the share of physical gross merchandise sales sold on Amazon by independent third-party sellers – mostly small- and medium-sized businesses – as opposed to Amazon retail's own first party sales. Third-party sales have grown from 3% of the total to 58%. To put it bluntly: Third-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly.…. Why were independent sellers able to grow so much faster than Amazon's own highly organized first-party sales organization? There isn't one answer, but we do know one extremely important part of the answer: We helped independent sellers compete against our first-party business by investing in and offering them the very best selling tools we could imagine and build. There are many such tools, including tools that help sellers manage inventory, process payments, track shipments, create reports, and sell across borders – and we're inventing more every year.”      ISS is looking for a result driven Senior Applied Scientist to join and manage its Science team in Seattle. The Applied Scientist will work closely with other research scientists, data scientists and economists to design new frameworks that systematically identify, low touch machine learning powered recommendations that propel seller growth while creating a meaningful economic impact for Amazon.

What you'll be doing   ML-Infrastructure: Help build a first-class machine learning platform from the ground up which helps manage the entire model lifecycle: feature engineering, model training/evaluation, versioning, deployment/online serving and monitoring prediction quality.  Data Analysis/Feature Engineering: Apply your expertise to identify and calculate features that can be leveraged by multiple use cases as well as models.  Model training with batch and real-time prediction scenarios: Use machine learning and statistical modeling techniques such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Bayesian Analysis, Neural Networks and others to develop and evaluate algorithms to improve product/system performance, quality and accuracy.
