These teams are both part of a group called Technical Excellence, which also is made up of 5 sector-specific Technical Units advising on our main programming areas (Education, Economic Recovery and Development, Governance, Health, and Violence Prevention and Response) across six different regions of the world. The Senior Data Analyst will be responsible for leading the analysis (and sometimes collection and cleaning) of data relevant to Technical Excellence leaders. This will mean managing and analyzing sophisticated metrics to measure progress across key strategic areas, including program design, client satisfaction, partnerships volume, client reach, research and evidence, programmatic quality assurance, business development, staffing capacity, and more. While some analyses will be repeated (quarterly, for example) other requests may be one-off or require partnership with other departments such as Finance, IT, or technical and implementing program teams. This role will respond principally to inquiries from Technical Excellence leadership asking how we can utilize multiple complex internal datasets and databases to offer management insights into whether we are achieving our strategic goals and where our resources (financial and human) should be allocated. The datasets of focus for the Senior Data Analyst will likely span from budgets and spending data to win rates, grants tracking, time & effort salary tracking, and programmatic data.  The successful Analyst will need to have a (moderate) tolerance for messy or imperfect data sets, and an enthusiasm for working to improve systems from within. This role will be a thought partner as well as analytic support for our strategic plan (Strategy 100) leaders to ensure their targets can be measured, tracked, triangulated, discussed with nuance, and presented clearly. The Data Analyst will also be asked to provide recommendations on system enhancements that would help us capture, store, and better analyze the data needed to answer questions from leadership. As the role evolves, the Analyst will take on a proactive role planning for and coordinating data needs across Technical Excellence, advising on what would help us build a coherent and useful data ecosystem from both available and planned datasets.  The Senior Data Analyst will fill a critical (and in demand!) gap in the department, becoming an organizational expert in multiple large datasets and providing advice to staff at many levels about the best ways to use and compare internal data. The role is a new position, and the ideal Analyst will not just be a skilled, accurate number cruncher, but also a clear communicator thinking creatively to help those less comfortable with our data to plan how to use it for better decision making. The role will focus on people (mentoring colleagues and explaining concepts), processes (cleaning data, statistical analyses, establishing routines for data planning and review), and technology (Power BI visualization, data extraction, and data architecture).  Major Responsibilities:   Analyze grants, finance, and program data from potentially all IRC data collection systems and databases (systems are called BVA/SUN, Integra, OTIS, Annual Statistics, and more)   Lead, manage, and support analytical projects for Technical Excellence leadership and our strategic plan leaders (Strategy 100), from programmatic analyses to financial analyses to HR analyses to projections and revenue forecasting, to inform decisions on resource allocation and help leaders monitor progress against organizational goals   Establish routines for data usage and reporting, and lead the continuous improvement of data routines   Support data reformatting and cleaning necessary to use our data to answer strategic questions   Help leaders craft metrics and tracking approaches to answer their questions, understanding the limitations of different data sources   Become an organizational expert on the strengths, weaknesses, and value of different internal datasets   Help colleagues understand and interpret data   Coordinate, consolidate, analyze, summarize, and visualize data into meaningful reports for relevant IRC departments   Support and sometimes lead the preliminary analysis/reporting for Technical Excellence leadership data review meetings and some Leadership Board quarterly strategic review content   Support other Technical Excellence and Strategy 100 leaders with their preparation for and delivery of internal presentations  Key Working Relationships:  You will report to:  the Deputy Director, Program Quality Strategy  and  the Director, Grant Operations and Analytics Team  Desired Qualifications:   5+ years of progressive work experience connected to data analytics   Successful experience analyzing complex sets of data and disseminating data that can be used to drive strategy and policy making   Experience using visualization tools such as PowerBI or Tableau   Tolerance for imperfect data and an excitement for finding insights in complicated data sources   Aptitude for and interest in offering creative solutions to problems discovered within our systems and procedures   Highly collaborative and pro-active colleague with a talent for delivering results with cross-functional groups   Strong communicator, with experience helping to demystify data for teammates   Some experience with data governance is a plus   Experience working with IRC data systems is a plus   Dedication to diversity, equity and inclusion, and a strong passion for our mission   Comfortable adapting to new challenges and dynamic priorities, while maintaining professional grace and (ideally!) a sense of humor  Advanced Microsoft Office skills (Excel, Powerpoint) and experience with organizational information and financial systems   Excellent written and verbal communication skills in a multi-cultural environment  University degree in Business Administration, Finance, International Development or a relevant quantitative field, or equivalent work experience   Fluent in English; French, Spanish or Arabic language a plus  Working Environment (assumes NY office)   Standard office working environment, flexibility to work remotely a significant amount of the time   Workspace booked via a desk reservation system in an open-plan office when in person   Limited travel expected   This role may require working remotely full or part time depending on pandemic and public health changes  Values and Legal Disclaimers  The IRC and IRC workers must adhere to the values and principles outlined in IRC Way - Standards for Professional Conduct. These are Integrity, Equality, Service, and Accountability. In accordance with these values, the IRC operates and enforces policies on Beneficiary Protection from Exploitation and Abuse, Child Safeguarding, Anti Workplace Harassment, Fiscal Integrity, and Anti-Retaliation.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.   From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the team  At Roku, the Data Science team lives and works on a kind of frontier: We get called in for things that haven't been done before. This requires meaningful collaboration with the platform team, the firmware team and even the finance team to prove or disprove new product ideas. Often the idea evolves from what was first proposed until it is a wholly new thing that gets shipped. No one here is ashamed to present their latest work, and you'll find yourself pitching ideas to others in the company, including to executives.   Beyond collaboration, we seek builders with the persistence to keep pushing. Because we spend our time making prototypes and testing brand new ideas on systems with a lot of moving parts, we are faced with failures every day. The only way to really make something work is to really dig into the reasons and understand why. We value the grit and persistence it takes to keep just trying.  About the role  Roku pioneered TV streaming and continues to innovate and lead the industry. The Roku Channel has us well-positioned to help shape the future of streaming. Continued success relies on investing in Data Science and diving deep into the economics of our business.   This role is right for you if you enjoy diving into messy data, cleaning it up, finding powerful insights, presenting them in a compelling way, developing models and then working closely with software engineers to automate this process, to prove it out at scale. You should also relish the ability to influence the direction of the team's strategic goals, question the inherent assumptions in our thinking, and defining the business objectives in an innovative and encouraging environment.   The ideal candidate will have endless curiosity and can pair a global mindset with locally relevant execution. You should be a gritty problem solver and self-starter who can drive programs with the product and commercial teams within Roku and across external strategic partner organizations. The successful candidate will display a balance of hard and soft skills, including the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.  What you'll be doing  Develop data science algorithms to improve user experience on Roku's platform.  Develop economic models (e.g., market design, pricing, program evaluation, and forecasting) to better understand the user experience on Roku's platform.  Run live experiments to prototype the improvements and prove their efficacy.  Dive into data, clean it up, and pull-out insights that can be used to improve system performance and present to senior leaders with recommendations on business actions.  Assist the development team with productization of successful algorithms, ensuring your work continues to drive value at scale.  Provide expert consultative assistance to other teams in the company, including data scientists working in other areas of Roku's stack and provide technical feedback on their econometric work.  Contribute to the technical vision of the Data Science team.  We're excited if you have  PhD Degree  6 yrs + of experience post PhD in Machine Learning, Operations Research, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, or similar quantitative field.  Experience in causal Machine Learning and experimentation.  Proven problem solving and analytical abilities.  Software development skills in Python, Java, Julia or Scala.  Proficiency with analysis tools such as Spark, R, MATLAB or similar.  Experience with TB or PB size datasets preferred.  Nice-to-have's include knowledge of user behavior in subscription and advertising-based video, auctions and/or advertising.  The Roku culture  Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.   We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible. For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. The best fit for the role is someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications. This is a full-time role. We are based in New York, but welcome remote applications from everywhere About the company Runway is building the next generation of creative tools. We are a small team of artists, engineers, developers, and researchers working together to predict-by-inventing the future. Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford. We have built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become  smarter  in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old  Creative Suite  for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in  how  we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.  Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú. We are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.  Requirements: Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM). Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight. Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV. Experience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. Opinionated about writing robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs.
