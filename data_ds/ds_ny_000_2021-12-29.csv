Every year, billions of dollars, hundreds of megatons of carbon and millions of person-hours are wasted because the companies who ship goods and the companies who carry them aren’t upfront about their needs and abilities. Our platform finds ways for buyers and sellers to contract binding commitments for plannable and predictable freight and allows those contracts to be traded when needs change. In time, Leaf will become the hub through which the trillion-dollar American freight market is managed.

You should be curious, relentless about asking questions until you understand something, and unafraid to acknowledge facts that don’t point in the direction you want them to. Be humble in the face of data, but tenacious in asserting the facts you know. Be willing to work with people you disagree with; be eager for criticism, and constantly searching for ways to do what you do better. Never be content with things the way they are, but don’t let the quest for something perfect prevent you from shipping something good. Experience in wider supply chain, especially truckload, is useful. You will need to be experienced with Python, and SQL as well as familiarity with the majority of the following:  Geospatial analysis  Pattern recognition  Clustering  Time series forecasting  Graph-theoretic techniques for network analysis We’re also a startup, priorities change all the time, something’s always on fire, and there’s twice as much work to do as hands to do it and new challenges surface constantly, and that you will need to be able to manage how you spend your time in the midst of conflicting priorities. #LI-remote Compensation Leaf offers a very comprehensive compensation package including competitive base salary, variable compensation and health benefits.

You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)

For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible. For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. The best fit for the role is someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications.

Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford. We have built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become  smarter  in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old  Creative Suite  for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in  how  we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.  Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú. We are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.  Requirements: Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM). Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight. Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV.

Are you interested in cloud computing? Are you passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? Yes? We have a role you might find interesting. Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and challenge the status quo. They seek to address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that’s capital, engineering resource, or experience. This is where you come in. We are looking for technical builders with a background in AI and ML who love the idea of working with startups that differentiate their product via the application of Machine Learning. In this role, you’ll work directly with these customers, helping them make the build and deploy their products, services, and models in the cloud successfully. You’ll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor. As well as spending time working directly with customers, you’ll also get plenty of time to “sharpen the saw” and keep your skills fresh. We have more than 175 services across a range of different categories and it’s important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You’ll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products and features for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don’t get to work with on a 1:1 basis you’ll share knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events. About the hiring group The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with these early stage startup companies as they build their businesses. We’re here to make sure that they can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible – and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so.

We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust. Work/Life Balance Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. Mentorship & Career Growth Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded professional and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

From the creator of the popular framework PyTorch Lightning, Grid is a platform for training models that enables rapid research iteration. Grid aims to simplify scalable AI research so that when a network becomes complex, code doesn't.  Focus on Machine Learning, Not Infrastructure.  Grid.ai is backed by $18.6 million in funding from Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Firstminute. Grid is a remote-first company founded by William Falcon and Luis Capelo.  What's important to us  We are building a company of people that care deeply about the impact of AI on our society.

We empower our community, clients, and colleagues to tackle the impossible.  Curiosity: We are genuinely interested in finding solutions to advance the state of AI research and foster its application in novel products. It's not about whether we can solve the problem, but how.  We also feel that it's essential to point out the self-evident here – there's a genuine lack of diversity in our industry, which has to change. One of our goals is to help drive that change. Grid.ai is fully committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of its practices, especially when it comes to growing our team. Our culture promotes inclusion, and we embrace how rewarding it is to work with people from all walks of life.

These teams are both part of a group called Technical Excellence, which also is made up of 5 sector-specific Technical Units advising on our main programming areas (Education, Economic Recovery and Development, Governance, Health, and Violence Prevention and Response) across six different regions of the world. The Senior Data Analyst will be responsible for leading the analysis (and sometimes collection and cleaning) of data relevant to Technical Excellence leaders. This will mean managing and analyzing sophisticated metrics to measure progress across key strategic areas, including program design, client satisfaction, partnerships volume, client reach, research and evidence, programmatic quality assurance, business development, staffing capacity, and more. While some analyses will be repeated (quarterly, for example) other requests may be one-off or require partnership with other departments such as Finance, IT, or technical and implementing program teams. This role will respond principally to inquiries from Technical Excellence leadership asking how we can utilize multiple complex internal datasets and databases to offer management insights into whether we are achieving our strategic goals and where our resources (financial and human) should be allocated. The datasets of focus for the Senior Data Analyst will likely span from budgets and spending data to win rates, grants tracking, time & effort salary tracking, and programmatic data.
