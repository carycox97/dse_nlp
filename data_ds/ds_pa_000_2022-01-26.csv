Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science (SCS) is widely recognized as one of the first and the best computer science programs in the world. Our programs train the next generation of innovators to take real-world problems and improve the way people live and work. Headquartered at Carnegie Mellon University, the Delphi research group was founded in 2012 to advance the theory and practice of epidemic forecasting. Pre-pandemic our focus was seasonal influenza; now it's COVID. Currently our focus is on developing and maintaining COVIDcast , which provides the nation's largest repository of diverse, geographically-detailed, real-time indicators of COVID activity. We work on the full data pipeline: several of the underlying data sources (on which these indicators are built) would not exist or be publicly available without our efforts; and on the other end, we use these indicators to power our nowcasting and forecasting models. COVIDcast is used regularly by public health officials, government agencies, data journalists, healthcare companies, financial firms, and fellow modelers. We work closely with the CDC, and are currently a CDC Center of Excellence for Forecasting (one of two nationally). We are looking for a talented engineer to prevent, identify, diagnose, and rectify problems or outages that occur in the data processing pipelines for our indicators. This person will ideally have competency in linux systems administration, basic database & script programming, data analysis, and software engineering in a team setting. This is a combination of site reliability, operations, system administration, and light project management work. We currently run 12 individual indicator pipelines for tracking COVID, producing nearly 200 distinct time series. We're on schedule to exceed 2B data points over the summer, and plan to massively expand our coverage to include influenza in the coming months. Our job scheduling system was developed in-house, but for monitoring we use Elastic/Kibana and NewRelic. You do not need to have specific experience with either to apply.

With experienced leaders in the field and collaborative partnerships with some of the world's largest automakers, we're building self-driving technology that is engineered to scale globally and transform mobility for millions.  Talented individuals join our team because they share our purpose to make it safe, easy, and enjoyable for everyone to get around cities. We aspire to impact key industries that move people and goods, from ride hailing to deliveries.  Meet the team:  Our team delivers solutions to camera-based perception problems on the autonomous vehicle platform. These problems include object detection, scene segmentation, and various classification and regression problems. Perception is key to obstacle avoidance, prediction of actor behavior, and planning the motion of the vehicle itself. Our team takes algorithms that allow the vehicle to reason about the world around it from the lab to the road - everything from reading and understanding the research literature to deployment of production-grade vision systems on the vehicle. Understanding a large, messy, unstructured world in real-time is essential to the success of any autonomous robotics program, and one of the most challenging and fulfilling aspects of the work here at Argo.  We're looking for a talented senior-level machine learning engineer to join us. The ideal candidate should have experience building computer-vision-focused machine learning pipelines, controlling for all of precision, recall, computational performance, memory use, and multi-task tradeoffs. You should be comfortable reading papers, working on highly nontrivial problems without obvious solutions, and pushing the boundaries of the state of the art.  What you'll do:   Develop spatiotemporal machine learning models that capture behavior and state of scenes.  Read the literature, look at raw data, design state-of-the-art solutions, and productize them all the way from lab through to the test track, and ultimately bring them to public roads.  Act as a force multiplier across the team: use your experience to provide a voice of reason and knowledge, and identify opportunities for improvements that scale the engineering team further.  Build relationships with upstream and downstream partners and work cross-functionally to deliver high-impact features that improve our perception system.   What you'll need to succeed:   Degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related field.  Expert-level machine learning knowledge and experience, with a successful track record of developing and deploying deep learning solutions using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar.  Experience with camera-based systems and computer vision.  Experience shipping computer vision software products to industry or consumers.   Nice to haves:   Ph.D. with machine learning focus, or equivalent experience.  Experience developing and deploying temporal computer vision models (for instance, video activity recognition or using multiple frames for improved results on other tasks).   What we offer you:   High-quality individual and family medical, dental, and vision insurance  Competitive compensation packages  Employer-matched 401(k) retirement plan with immediate vesting  Employer-paid group term life insurance and the option to elect voluntary life insurance  Paid parental leave  Paid medical leave  Unlimited vacation  Complimentary daily lunches, beverages, and snacks  Pre-tax commuter benefits  Monthly wellness stipend  Professional development reimbursement  Employee assistance program  Discounted programs that include legal services, identity theft protection, pet insurance, and more  Company and team bonding outlets: employee resource groups, quarterly team activity stipend, and wellness initiatives   Our Background:  Argo AI was founded in late 2016 by industry experts with extensive experience building robotic systems for commercial applications. Our once-small team has since grown into an over 1,000-person strong company with strategic partnerships with two of the world's leading automakers: Ford and Volkswagen. Our self-driving system is the first with commercial deployment plans for Europe and the U.S., and thanks to an ability to tap into both automakers' global reach, our technology platform has the largest geographic deployment potential of any self-driving technology to date.  At Argo AI, we believe that embracing differences delivers superior results.
