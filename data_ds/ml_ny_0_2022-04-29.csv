Enterprises of all sizes have begun to adopt cloud offerings from google docs to box to slack: work that once took place in a single office building or behind a firewall is now happening out on the open internet, and criminals are very aware of the opportunities to steal data, hijack important financial information, and otherwise compromise companies that use these cloud services. Help us build a new layer of protection that will give enterprises the same level of security for their cloud offerings as Abnormal Security's industry leading products do in the email security space.

This role straddles the line between velocity and excellence.   As a Founding Machine Learning Engineer of the ATO team, you will:   Build detection systems capable of highlighting rare suspicious activity (one in a million) with +95% precision & <1minute latency on the aforementioned event stream  Help solve a multi-layered detection problem - from modeling communication patterns to establish enterprise-wide baselines, to normalizing across multiple event sources, to making use of contextual information to avoid false positives (e.g. comparing unusual sign in locations with travel records)  Calibrate behavior across our customers from multiple industries, with different usage patterns to provide consistent performance.  Predict the intent and the nature of threats (e.g. is it insider threat or an account takeover), while using data from today's attacks to help us detect and prevent the attacks of tomorrow  Contribute in other areas of the stack: building and debugging data pipelines, or presenting results back to customers in our tools when the occasion arises.  Participate in building a world-class detection engine across all layers - data quality, feature engineering, model development, experimentation and operation.

After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.           Job Description    The Payment Platform is an open, global financial services platform for developers who serve sellers. It provides the necessary components to manage identity, process payments across multiple channels, hold and transfer funds, and provide accounting, reconciliation, and reporting in a secure and compliant way.        We process billions of dollars worth of transactions every year. At that scale, even small optimizations can lead to a major impact. As a Machine Learning Engineer on Payment Platform, you will partner with software engineers, product managers, and data scientists to seamlessly integrate machine learning into our payment processing. Current work includes building models to optimize pricing, improve payment routing, reduce decline rates, and predict transaction costs.        Our algorithms derive value from our unique and rich data. We partner with business, product, and engineering teams to drive optimal decision-making using sophisticated modeling and machine learning techniques. We’re a passionate team of scientists and engineers who are shipping machine learning models that make payments efficient, effective, and low-cost for Square.

Based in the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco, we've been building together since 2016 and are trusted by customers including Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and more. We're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people we reach worldwide and a company where everyone can thrive.  About the role:  You'll lead the engineering effort for top-of-the-funnel user acquisition at Notion, including product improvements and marketing strategies that could drive significant new user growth. Driving our efforts in these areas will involve everything from full-stack product work, to data engineering, to experimentation. You'll straddle technical work and engineering management at first but will have the opportunity to move more into the latter over time.  This is a highly cross-functional role and you'll work closely with peers from across the company—but especially in our Marketing, Data Science, and Growth organizations—and get deep exposure to how Notion's  business  works. As an engineering leader at Notion, you will also contribute to up-leveling Notion's engineering organization as a whole, working on everything from engineering processes and roadmap to culture and values.  What You'll Achieve:  You'll set the technical direction for our growth and marketing systems—work that spans multiple technical disciplines, including machine learning, data engineering, and full-stack development.  You'll help build and lead a diverse and inclusive team of engineers working on a major driver of Notion user and revenue growth.  You'll collaborate closely with cross-functional peers in Marketing, Data Science, Data Engineering, and Growth to set the strategy and roadmap for your team.  You'll be responsible for driving fast execution and maintaining a high-quality bar for everything your team ships.  You'll recruit, coach, and develop engineers; you'll ensure engineers are regularly receiving feedback and are making progress on personal and professional goals.  You'll participate in shaping how Notion's engineering organization works—you'll help develop our technical practices, recruiting and onboarding strategy, planning and prioritization process, and more.  Skills You'll Need to Bring:  You have worked on or with a team building a modern marketing tech stack and have deep understanding of the tools that power marketing automation, experimentation, personalization, attribution, and analytics.  You have experience managing engineering teams with a record of shipping in a fast-paced environment, or you have multiple years of experience as a technical lead, with exposure to prioritization, cross-team collaboration, and engineer mentorship.  You create team environments that are at once collaborative, empowering, supportive, and challenging—ones where engineers do their best work; you have built, or are committed to building, diverse and inclusive teams.  You value empathetic and direct communication—you give and receive feedback effectively and can drive alignment between engineering teams or between engineering and cross-functional partners.  You have a sufficiently deep background in product and technology to ask the right questions and think through different tradeoffs.  You have a high tolerance for ambiguity and change. You enjoy jumping into whatever areas need attention and learning as you go.  Nice to Haves:  You have familiarity with commonly used tools in the data, marketing, and growth worlds: Segment, Customer.io, dbt, and Amplitude, for example.  You have experience supporting growth marketing efforts such as performance marketing, search engine marketing, search engine optimization, and lifecycle marketing.  You have managed engineering teams at startups before, particularly during periods of rapid growth and organizational change.  You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.   Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.  Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

The project’s goal is to learn unified high-dimensional distributed representations of patients using healthcare data from multiple modalities, including medical imaging, electronic health records (EHRs), and wearable sensors, among others. Furthermore, the projects will also involve exploring ways to leverage longitudinal (temporal) patient data to learn such representations.         The postdocs will work with Prof. Sumit Chopra and Prof. Daniel Sodickson. Learning accurate and useful patient representations will require working at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and physics-based modeling. There are many scenarios under which such representations can be learned, including using unimodal/multimodal and static/dynamic (temporal) datasets. Despite the enormous promise of machine learning applications in healthcare, the deployment of machine learning models in real clinical settings has remained elusive. The projects will also focus on exploring ways to utilize representations to derive real clinical benefits, such as improving diagnostic accuracy, speeding up image acquisition, and proposing personalized treatment plans.         Through this position, you will be a part of (and working at the intersection of) two of the most sought-after schools in their respective fields, namely the Courant Institute (a leader in applied mathematics and machine learning) and the Grossman School of Medicine (a leader in healthcare research and delivery). This opportunity will also allow you to readily deploy your research in a clinical setting within the hospital, thereby enabling you to make a real-world impact, saving and/or improving the lives of real people.         The positions are available immediately. They are full-time appointments for one year, with the possibility of renewal for up to three years. The renewal is subject to satisfactory performance and availability of funds.

Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Verification Engine, the backbone of all our products that protect enterprises from sophisticated bots. Today we verify the humanity of more than 15 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms across the internet.                  Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to helping protect companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by malicious bots. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive benefits and day-to-day culture in order for every human to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).                  The HUMAN R&D team is pivotal to our mission to protect the heart of the internet by disrupting the economics of cybercrime. They are the ones uncovering and fighting bot operations like PARETO, ICEBUCKET, 3ve, and Methbot. HUMAN supports our R&D humans by strongly valuing deep work and flexibility. Company-wide meeting-free Fridays give you uninterrupted time to work on your projects. Additionally, this team is encouraged to participate in R&D Research Friday - a designated half-day each week dedicated to trying new ideas and personal career development. HUMAN is fully committed to flexible working arrangements, or as we call it, work from anywhere, anytime. All of this is to ensure our humans are able to do the best work of their lives.                  We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN.                  DS@HUMANsec              The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception.                  The human we need for this role will work on      BotGuard : our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.                    What you will do:             Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product.  Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work.  Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate.  Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy.  Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers.  Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you.                          Who you are:             You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!).  You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers.  You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate.  Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well.  You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles.  You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.                          Benefits & Perks             Unlimited PTO  Private medical and dental insurance for all full-time employees  Fully paid parental leave  Learning & Development budget  Phenomenal coaching from senior leaders and challenging development opportunities  Monthly internet, phone bill, and meal stipend to support working remotely during COVID-19  Company-sponsored TalkSpace membership for you and your family                          Life at HUMAN:                   HUMAN  prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!                  With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, with teams in London, Virginia, and Victoria, we trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The benefits package we provide reflects our remote-first culture and our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development. We also offer weekly lunches, flexible time off, no-meeting Fridays, HUMAN days, sabbatical programs, and so much more.                  We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.

By arming ship owners and operators with real-time predictive decision support, Nautilus is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and making global trade sustainable. Ocean shipping consumes over $100 billion dollars of fuel every year, and up to 30% of it can be saved. For owner-operators, reliance on manually collected and analyzed data makes it difficult to optimize fleet performance in real-time. By providing a unified data platform that leverages machine learning, Nautilus helps its clients make better decisions to maximize the return on each ship and every voyage. For our clients, this means they drive closer collaboration, greater transparency, and stronger accountability across their global teams every day.   About you.

You will work closely with other data scientists, data analysts, and software engineers to build, test, and deploy robust ship performance models. You will partner with our product team to help conceptualize, design, and implement new machine learning-based products. While we are a collaborative team, you will also take independent ownership of research and development projects. Your work will help drive product development throughout the Nautilus team, and support better client decision-making to help meet their fuel efficiency and sustainability goals.   Proficiencies.  5+ years of professional experience and/or advanced degree (MA/MS or PhD), with a background in data science, statistics, computer science, physics, naval architecture, mechanical engineering, or another related quantitative field.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9d857d275937a0cd&from=web&vjs=3,300,"Lead Machine Learning Engineer, Fraud Risk",Block,"New York, NY","    Company Description    Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.           Job Description    The Fraud Machine Learning & Decision Science (MLDS) team within Square Risk is looking for a Machine Learning Tech Lead. This senior role will be responsible for driving machine learning technology strategy for Fraud at Square. This is a very visible role and touches on developing event-driven intelligent software across all money movement (and other events) across the entire Square seller ecosystem of products.    This touches on actively maximizing the trade-off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning-driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning/representation learning, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller-facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.    This role will closely collaborate with product managers across the fraud vertical, Risk leaders, and other machine learning teams within the Risk Engineering and Machine Learning & Decision Science organization as well as ML teams across Square and Block. This also includes collaboration with various ML platform teams both within Risk across Block.     You Will         Drive technical ML strategy across the Fraud vertical within Square Risk      Collaborate with and mentor other machine learning engineers in the team      Build machine learning/deep learning models that detect risk (e.g., fraud) activity in real-time across the Square seller ecosystem consisting of payments, banking, and other commerce enablement-related products.      Balance deeply technical concepts with creative “forward-thinking” growth principles to balance the tradeoff between risk and growth by looking holistically across the Square ecosystem.      Collaborate with business leaders, subject matter experts, and decision-makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models              Qualifications    You Have         An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics or a related technical field.      PhD with 4+ years (or Master 6+ years) industry working experience on applied Machine learning or Deep learning in a production environment with a history of delivering value to customers and the business.      A strong track record of performing modern machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, etc.) within machine learning software development lifecycle paradigms.      Expert-level knowledge of modern techniques in machine learning and deep learning, e.g., transformer network architectures, with an orientation to maximizing such algorithms in a large-scale production setting. The reinforcement learning experience is a plus for developing optimal control policies      Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation.      Machine learning strategic sequencing of methodological and software improvements to work back from maximizing core metrics associated with optimizing the business.      The ability to clearly communicate (verbal and written) complex results to technical and non-technical audiences and stakeholders (PMs, Operations, Engineers).

The Department of Public and Ecosystem Health mission is to use a transdisciplinary, systems approach to tackle the world’s most pressing challenges that involve the inter-dependent health of people, animals, and the ecosystems on which all life depends. Rather than organize around a common discipline or approach, Public & Ecosystem Health brings public health professionals, biophysical and social scientists, and veterinarians together to address three of the world’s greatest challenges: achieving healthy food systems, tackling emerging health threats, and conserving biodiversity. We seek not only to understand these wicked problems through research, but also to address them directly through public health and clinical veterinary practice. Quite simply, our students, staff, and faculty seek to change the world.

Apply generalized linear models and machine learning techniques to antimicrobial resistance data.       Draft manuscripts and publish results in high-quality, peer-reviewed journals.       Use best-practices for reproducible coding.       Present results at conferences and seminars.       Contribute to developing and writing grant proposals.              Qualifications:           Ph.D. degree in Epidemiology, Microbiology, Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, or a related discipline or a health professional doctorate (e.g., DVM, MD) with substantial experience in one of these fields.

Access to affordable housing isn't just a problem - it's a global crisis. An estimated seven million affordable and available rental homes are needed in just the US alone, and no amount of government spending or policy have proven to be effective solutions.  MeetElise uses machine learning to address the underlying cause preventing significant advancements in affordable housing: operational costs. By automating the leasing and management of apartment homes, we're creating a new, low cost operating model that allows for the development of new housing at scale.  Our first product is an AI leasing agent named Elise that converts 65% more prospective renters to residents than a human leasing agent. She answers questions and schedules tours 24/7 and is so human-like that renters say they're ""here to meet Elise"" when they show up for a tour.  MeetElise is well-funded by VCs, strategic real estate investors, and customers and was started by technical cofounders from MIT and the University of Cambridge.  Our small, courageous team is building the future we want to live in. A future where housing is affordable, powered by technology, and accessible to all .  About The Role  Sometimes clients have questions about how MeetElise works, need a configuration change or would like to report an issue with our product.  When they contact us their expectations are high: they want prompt, courteous service that quickly resolves their issue.  But our systems are complex, each client has their own configuration and working with an AI-powered virtual leasing assistant is a new concept. Sometimes issues can take multiple days and involve multiple teams to fully solve.  Support specialists remove the complexity for our customers.

In addition to being technical problem solvers they're also adept communicators, able to manage customer expectations while delivering crystal clear communication that takes the sting out of any issues a customer is experiencing.

We’re dedicated to empowering this transformation by building the tools and infrastructure developers need to create their own products. Plaid powers the tools millions of people rely on to live a healthier financial life. We work with thousands of companies like Venmo and SoFi, several of the Fortune 500, and many of the largest banks to make it easy for people to connect their financial accounts to the apps and services they want to use. Plaid’s network covers 11,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada, UK and Europe. Founded in 2013, the company is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in New York, Salt Lake City, Washington D.C., London and Amsterdam.                  Transactions Platform gives Plaid products access to the full potential of transactions data, our largest and richest dataset. While the domain-specific interpretation of transactions varies wildly between use cases, the basics remain the same: “what type of transaction is this?”, “what are the recurring trends in this account’s history?”, “what merchants/organizations does this consumer interact with?”. The mission of Transactions Platform is to make answering these questions trivial, so that the Product teams can focus on their core competency, and not on building yet another regex pattern library. We take a holistic approach, from studying the data available and designing high-quality labeling pipelines to training ML models and implementing structural parsers.                  As a member of our team, you’ll collaborate with product stakeholders (PMs, engineers) to determine the highest platform needs, and work to implement them.
