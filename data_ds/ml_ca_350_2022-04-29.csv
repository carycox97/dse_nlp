https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=e0297c14eff247ef&from=web&vjs=3,540,Backend Engineer,Render,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA","             When deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.                  Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new kinds of applications.                  We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and PostgreSQL, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for engineers with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.                  Our platform serves over a billion requests every month, and we have tens of thousands of users including Stripe, NYU, and US presidential campaigns. We have product-market fit and rapidly increasing revenue, and we're backed by the same early stage investors behind Airbnb, Snap, and Stripe.                  As a backend engineer at Render, you will take complete, end-to-end ownership of projects across the entire stack. You should already have experience building products across the stack and have a keen understanding of web frameworks, APIs, databases and multiple backend languages.                  Engineering at Render                   We're a small team of world-class engineers. We have complete, end-to-end ownership for every project we take on and expect the same from you. We review all major code changes through pull requests and are always pushing ourselves to do better. We iterate quickly and deploy to production several times a day.                  Technical challenges                   The biggest issues with platforms like Heroku are lack of flexibility, and cost. We are solving the cost problem by using containers and Kubernetes and intelligently scaling compute resources up and down. This will continue to be a major area of engineering investment for us going forward.                  We solve lack of flexibility by using Kubernetes under the hood and abstracting all the associated complexity so our users get all the benefits (load balancing, service discovery, autoscaling, health checks, self-healing) without needing to manage Kubernetes or build everything on AWS.                  The challenge is in building the right user-facing abstractions that make simple application deployments effortless and complex application deployments possible. User experience is our primary focus and drives everything we do.                    Projects you might work on             We run our Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud Platform and AWS. You will enable Render's clusters to run on other clouds and eventually in our own data-centers. You will also allow our users to connect Render resources with their private networks in existing public cloud infrastructure.  You will create an effortless serverless abstraction on Render and enable per-request billing for containerized resources.  You will build a managed MySQL product for Render users.  You will use machine learning to optimize container scheduling and save resources while keeping user workloads responsive.  Render works great with GitHub and GitLab repos. You will add Bitbucket integration.  You will build out Render's CLI and make the user dashboard even better.  You will create open source projects and documentation in multiple languages and frameworks to demo Render's features.                          You are a great fit for this role if             You have a few years of professional experience shipping software. Bonus points if you’ve excelled at a small, high-growth startup.  You have an intuitive understanding of web frameworks, APIs, and databases, and have worked with multiple programming languages.  You are both curious by nature and an impressively quick learner.

How we're dealing with COVID             We encourage everyone to take a half day off from work every week, because we can all use some time off to manage the additional stress from the pandemic.                          Working at Render                   We value high integrity, low ego, an affinity for continuous learning, and the ability to figure things out quickly.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=2c1b2b293fea5a7b&from=web&vjs=3,540,Full-Stack Engineer,Render,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA","             When deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.                  Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new kinds of applications.                  We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and PostgreSQL, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for engineers with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.                  Our platform serves over a billion requests every month, and we have tens of thousands of users including Stripe, NYU, and US presidential campaigns. We have product-market fit and rapidly increasing revenue, and we're backed by the same early stage investors behind Airbnb, Snap, and Stripe.                  As a full-stack engineer at Render, you will take complete, end-to-end ownership of projects across the entire stack. You should already have experience building products across the stack and have a keen understanding of web frameworks, APIs, databases and multiple backend languages.                  Engineering at Render                   We're a small team of world-class full-stack engineers. We have complete, end-to-end ownership for every project we take on and expect the same from you. We review all major code changes through pull requests and are always pushing ourselves to do better. We iterate quickly and deploy to production several times a day.                  Technical challenges                   The biggest issues with platforms like Heroku are lack of flexibility, and cost. We are solving the cost problem by using containers and Kubernetes and intelligently scaling compute resources up and down. This will continue to be a major area of engineering investment for us going forward.                  We solve lack of flexibility by using Kubernetes under the hood and abstracting all the associated complexity so our users get all the benefits (load balancing, service discovery, autoscaling, health checks, self-healing) without needing to manage Kubernetes or build everything on AWS.                  The challenge is in building the right user-facing abstractions that make simple application deployments effortless and complex application deployments possible. User experience is our primary focus and drives everything we do.                    Projects you might work on             We run our Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud Platform and AWS. You will enable Render's clusters to run on other clouds and eventually in our own data-centers. You will also allow our users to connect Render resources with their private networks in existing public cloud infrastructure.  You will create an effortless serverless abstraction on Render and enable per-request billing for containerized resources.  You will build a managed MySQL product for Render users.  You will use machine learning to optimize container scheduling and save resources while keeping user workloads responsive.  Render works great with GitHub and GitLab repos. You will add Bitbucket integration.  You will build out Render's CLI and make the user dashboard even better.  You will create open source projects and documentation in multiple languages and frameworks to demo Render's features.                          You are a great fit for this role if             You have a few years of professional experience shipping software. Bonus points if you’ve excelled at a small, high-growth startup.  You have an intuitive understanding of web frameworks, APIs, and databases, and have worked with multiple programming languages.  You are both curious by nature and an impressively quick learner.  You are unfazed by unfamiliar codebases and enjoy figuring things out on your own.  You can wear multiple hats and work across the stack, both collaboratively and independently.  The ideal candidate would check everything above, but you should certainly apply if you identify with most of it.                          Why join us             We're solving a problem faced by every developer and development team. It's a massive and rapidly growing market (AWS is privately valued at over $200B, and there are over 20 million professional developers globally).  We serve over 1 billion requests every month, our users love us, and our revenue is growing quickly.  Our stock grants are in the 99th percentile.  Everyone wants to move their infrastructure to Kubernetes, but it's too complex for the average development team. Render makes it possible to get the power of Kubernetes without any of its complexity.  The former CTOs of VMware and Dropbox are two of our biggest investors and cheerleaders.  The company is led by Anurag Goel, who was employee #8 and Head of Risk at Stripe. He helped Stripe scale from 10 to over 400 people and is applying many of the same principles that helped Stripe succeed to Render.                          Benefits we offer             Competitive cash and equity compensation with early exercise options and extended exercise windows.  4 weeks of paid vacation, available from day one.  12 weeks of fully paid parental leave for all parents to bond with a newly born, adopted, or fostered child. We will also work with you to create a supportive plan of return.  Long-term disability, life insurance, and 401K plans.  100% employer-paid medical coverage and 99% employer-paid dental and vision coverage for you and a dependent. FSAs available too.  Monthly wellness stipend.  Continuous learning benefits & related support.                          How we're dealing with COVID             We encourage everyone to take a half day off from work every week, because we can all use some time off to manage the additional stress from the pandemic.                          Working at Render                   We value high integrity, low ego, an affinity for continuous learning, and the ability to figure things out quickly. We're always open to being wrong, and we love to improve our work through reasoned discussion and constant feedback. We trust and respect each other tremendously which makes doing all of this easy.                  We'd love to hear from you!         ",30+ days ago,

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=50375344892f72d1&from=web&vjs=3,640,Sr. Software Engineer - Full-stack (Language Agnostic),Sisu Data,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA","             At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.                  Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels.

The Wealthfront data science team creates data products to deliver personalized financial product experiences, develops best in class investment algorithms, and analyzes our rich financial and behavioral data to make key business decisions. The team draws from a variety of backgrounds in Computer Science & Engineering, Statistics, Economics, Math, Operations Research, and Financial Engineering. We derive strength from this diversity and are constantly learning and teaching each other in a down-to-earth and dynamic environment. We are neither too big where you would be just another cog in the system, nor are we too small that none of our efforts can be realized.                  As a Data Scientist in Wealthfront’s Data Science organization, you’ll be responsible for improving the quality of our decisions using data and the scientific method. Your work will generate tools and insights that inform product and business decisions throughout the company and across the product lifecycle, from ideation and research to launch and iteration. You will mentor and collaborate with your data science colleagues with a focus on technical skills and career development. We are fortunate to work with experienced product managers and engineers that have worked on products at companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple. This is an opportunity to learn from some of the most experienced operators in the startup world and to further an important and meaningful mission. Our Data Science team focuses on product analytics (for the product areas of Investments and Banking), A/B Testing, growth/marketing analytics, and risk analytics (fraud, credit).                    What you'll do             Work closely with cross-functional teams of product managers and engineers, translating open-ended business issues into data questions, identifying practical approaches including A/B testing to answer them, and carrying out timely and well-documented analyses that influence our product and company strategy  Design and develop data products to assist consumers with decisions around investments, banking, and financial planning  Continuously look for, and execute upon, opportunities to improve the quality of our data, infrastructure and products  Understand and communicate a data-driven picture of our clients, product and business  Promote automation of repetitive tasks and the creation of tools over ad hoc analyses, making your insights available to anyone that can benefit from them                          What we're looking for             Knowledge of Python and SQL toolchain to access, transform, visualize, and model business data  A firm foundation in data analysis basics including regression and classification models, experiment design, time series modeling and hypothesis testing  Ability and empathy to explain technical and statistical work to business stakeholders  Interest and ability to map business requirements and priorities to technical projects  Interest in continuous learning and mentoring others  BS, MS, or PhD in computer science, mathematics, statistics, economics or related field                         Everyone across the financial spectrum deserves to live secure and rewarding lives.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.                  About       Wealthfront                   Our first chapter was about transforming the investment advisory business. We focused on unlocking access to low cost investing for delegators - people who were underserved by high fee and human financial advisors. We built the first automated portfolio that allows you in seconds to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies for a remarkably low fee, which resulted in attracting more than $25 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry.                  Now, we’ve embarked on expanding into an adjacent opportunity to transform the digital self-directed brokerage space. This focus enables us to empower a dramatically wider audience to build long-term wealth - people who are eager to learn about investing by making their own investment decisions, but need guidance. In the last few years, several financial technology companies have made it incredibly accessible and engaging to trade in individual stocks, but because of their transaction based business models, these apps keep people focused on the day-to-day gyrations of the market leading to short-term thinking and behaviors. As a result, millions of people are investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks which is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We believe our vision serves their needs far better and that we can extend our core philosophy of embracing diversification, managing risk, minimizing fees and taxes and taking a long-term view, into self-directed investing. We believe this is an ideal opportunity to leverage our strength of building simple, easy-to-use products that offer a delightfully engaging experience to build long-term wealth.
