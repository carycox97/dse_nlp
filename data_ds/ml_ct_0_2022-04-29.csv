We believe that quality is owned by the entire team (not just the QA department). As a Quality Engineer, you have unique experience and expertise to help us identify areas we should consider and focus on, and we welcome your contributions in any setting.        We Are Transparent:  As a quality engineer on the team, you are expected to be an equal contributor to the success and quality of our product, and are empowered to raise issues and concerns as you identify them at any point in our development process (and not just when they enter the testing phase).
