We have grown from a groundbreaking research project at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence to a product millions of scholars use every week. Semantic Scholar uses artificial intelligence to extract the semantics, or meaning, of scientific literature and surface it to our users through a discovery experience that helps them understand science more effectively than any other tool.  Since our launch in 2015, we have indexed more than 180 million research papers and built a user base of millions of scholars in over 100 countries. Our work has been featured in the New York Times, Wired, Nature, Science, and many other publications. In March 2020, Semantic Scholar released the  CORD-19  dataset, a free resource of over 130,000 scholarly articles about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses for use by the global research community. The dataset is now updated daily and supports dozens of research initiatives around the world.  The Data Team software development manager owns the team and systems that fetch hundreds of millions of research paper data from myriad sources and create high quality, information- rich structured representations of research papers. These representations power the Semantic Scholar research knowledge graph, rich website experience, and a host of AI features. The quality and timeliness of this data is crucial to enabling Semantic Scholar's users to easily find and understand the latest research, which has a large multiplier effect in their ability to generate their own cutting-edge research.

The people  are whip-smart, deeply committed, and energizing.  The technology  is multi-patented, AI-powered, industry-shaping customer data management software that we invented because there was no way to solve the problems that we wanted to help consumer brands overcome.  The opportunity  is twofold: a market opportunity to provide a solution that consumer brands have been trying to find for decades, and a personal opportunity to grow and learn and hitch your career to a rocket ship.  Since our founding in 2016, Amperity has been growing 2.5X year-over-year. We've raised $187M in funding, including a recent Series D that increased our valuation to over one billion dollars. We're going places, fast, and we want you to come with us.  We help these brands make sense of massive amounts of transaction and engagement data so that they can finally know who their customers are, what opportunities exist, and how to provide the kinds of experiences that delight consumers and move the business metrics that matter. Our customers include Starbucks, Alaska Airlines, Patagonia, Kroger, J. Crew, Brooks Running, Planet Fitness, DICK's Sporting Goods, and many more.  We're building something that's never existed before, and we're doing it in a way that's great for consumers, transformational for our customers, and career-making for the members of the Amperity team.

Our customers use our predictions to analyze their customer base and create a personalized experience for their customers at every touchpoint.  Predictive modeling: With unified and enriched customer profiles (thanks to our identity matching pipeline), we build advanced customer-centric models to predict metrics/behaviors such as customer lifetime value, product recommendations, discount sensitivity, and event propensity.   In addition to algorithmic development, we value sharing our findings with the broader data science community.
