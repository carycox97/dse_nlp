https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=5e0849b3202788b4&from=web&vjs=3,230,Senior Data Scientist,eSpark Learning,Remote,"Overview  eSpark Learning puts fun and effective learning experiences in the hands of more than a million K-5 students around the USA, and can be found in 1-in-4 schools. After back to back years of 40+% revenue growth, we are looking to apply this success to our engineering organization and  double  our size in the next year so that we can further accelerate the growth of the business. In light of this, we are excited for senior data scientists to join the team who can have profound impact on the success of the company (as both contributors and leaders), and more fully realize their own potential by taking on responsibilities that align with their interests and passions.  The Role  As a Senior Data Scientist, you’ll join our engineering organization, reporting to the Director of Engineering, and help develop the practice and growth of data science across the company, in turn making the lives of teachers, students, principals, and other eSparkers better through your efforts. You’ll get your hands dirty with data to surface insights from our product, while also having the opportunity to help build out our data science function from the beginning, helping us define how we’ll conduct experiments, analyses, and other forms of quantitative research for years to come. We welcome candidates at the senior level or above, and will adapt title accordingly with experience.  There are three tenets all members of the team are expected to hold and embody:   We carry a growth mindset and drive our own development.  We believe that we do our best work when collaborating closely with others.  We care more deeply about the problems we’re solving than how they’re solved.   We believe that excitement to learn, a readiness to work together collaboratively, and good scientific and technical fundamentals are more important to success at eSpark than past experience with specific technologies or methodologies — we are always ready to pair and to train new staff on the methods we use. The applications our students and teachers use are built with Elm and Typescript on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend (all covered by tests), running on top of Docker and with data stored in MySQL and Redshift. In contrast, our data science technology is nascent, and actively being defined by the growing data functions at eSpark, including you.  Responsibilities  Use all of our data to generate insights across our chain-link of three stakeholders:  For students:  What behaviors are driving student learning? Why are certain learning resources more effective than others? What learning activities engage kids the most? The least? Are we serving all communities equitably?  For teachers:  What makes a teacher try eSpark with her class? What makes her stick around? How do eSpark usage and referrals spread within a school?  For administrators:  Which usage patterns in the classroom are predictive of a trial converting to a paid partnership? Do certain school attributes predict sales conversions?  Write software as needed to bridge the gap between the data we have and the data you need  Define and configure the tech stack for performant and reproducible analyses  Design and help build our experimentation platform  Support business goals by helping teachers find eSpark, sign up to use it in their classrooms, and advocate partnership to their administrators  Lead the experimental design around product and feature roll-outs  Participate in design and ideation around product and feature opportunities, using data to inform these decisions  Level up eSpark’s data science capabilities and knowledge across product, marketing, sales, and customer experience  Drive our understanding of the efficacy, equity, and fairness of our learning product for students of all backgrounds and circumstances  Participate in external research communities, and attend/publish work in academic and industry conferences like FaccT, COMPASS, WSDM, CIKM, KDD, AERA, NeurIPS, AIED, etc.   Benefits and Policies.  In addition to a competitive salary and stock options, eSpark offers full healthcare coverage (including vision, dental, and mental health benefits), generous vacation and parental leave policies. We are a fully-distributed company (circa March 2020) and provide benefits around outfitting your home-office arrangement, including your choice of technical equipment. We believe in work-life balance and respect nights and weekends.  The Interviews  The eSpark engineering team’s approach to interviewing is built on transparency, as we believe that everyone has a better, more productive experience when expectations are clear. For this role, we are looking for candidates who meet three specific criteria:   Self-sufficient scientist – You can design and implement analytic and experimental methods to answer important business questions independently, while leveraging the team for support.  Competent software engineer – You can write the code you need to gather and analyze the data for scientific work and develop and implement towards a vision for how this work can be done in a repeatable, reliable way into the future.  Capable strategic partner – You are quick to comprehend business and product context, allowing you to contribute to what we’re doing and why, with the ability to recognize and fill in the gaps as needed.   To learn about these three areas, and you in a general sense, we conduct three one-hour interviews with various teammates from eSpark, from engineering and beyond. We also ask for three references, to complete a full picture of you as a candidate. Written feedback or evaluations are also acceptable substitutes. We also recognize that not everyone has enjoyed a complete history of healthy working environments, and we are keen to work with you to identify appropriate individuals who can speak to your strengths and areas for growth.  For more context on our interview process, please refer to this document on Data Science Interviews at eSpark – What to Expect.  About eSpark  Vision.  Our vision is that every student, regardless of their circumstances or background, has the opportunity to set and realize an ambitious dream for themselves. Our mission is to re-imagine learning so it's student centered, enabling students to succeed in school and life.  Impact.  Our work makes a significant difference in students' lives. Independent testing data from public school districts across the country consistently show that students learn more in areas of personalized study with eSpark. One researcher from MIT, who evaluated an eSpark in Boston Public Schools, wrote: “I find strong positive, significant effects of eSpark for both math and English Language Arts (ELA). So the eSpark intervention, which is just 30 minutes a day, led to almost half the effect of a full year in a high performing charter school. I view these as very impressive gains. The findings made a substantial dent into the black-white achievement gap.”  Diversity.  At eSpark, we believe all people—adults and students alike—deserve respect for who they are. We work hard to make eSpark an environment in which everyone can thrive and succeed, supporting employees as individuals through people-centric management and as a company with our IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access) employee resource group. We believe it is critical that our team reflects the student populations we aim to serve.  Pandemic.  The 2020-2021 school year has been a time of unprecedented challenges for teachers, students, parents, and schools.  We believe — and have seen in last spring and fall — that eSpark’s personalized curriculum, made of fun and educational games and videos and adapted to each student; our commitment to providing teachers the tools and live support they need to support both remote and in-person learning; and our engaged team focused together on supporting educators and learners, can be a powerful help to teachers and to the students most at risk of falling behind during the pandemic.",30 days ago,

If interested, please send: CV, recommendation contact information and a GitHub link or other code example to info@datatecnica.com. Levine Lab Data Types : All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form. Mouse behavior Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc. Cellular activity (post-hoc): Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers Cellular activity (dynamic): Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the broader population of recorded cells Levine Lab Analysis Goals : Data analysis: Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar) Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position) Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions Recording from different populations of neurons Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types Different behavioral/motivational contexts Developmental age Spinal cord injury Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration Data Modeling: Physical forces/torques/biomechanics Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys) Dynamical systems modeling Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration Levine Lab SOW : Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing. The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative. Levine Lab Background : The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury. To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery. Ward Lab Data Types : Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint Ward Lab Analysis Goals : Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets. Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets) Ward Lab SOW Data analysis (as above) The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI) Ward Lab   Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI: Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible. Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions. Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI. Ward Lab background : The Ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We exclusively use genetically-modified human iPSCs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. iPSCs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. Almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.",30+ days ago,

With experts in software engineering, bioinformatics and program management, we focus on developing and applying technology tools and techniques to empower decision-making and accelerate the discovery in translational research. We work with some of the top research organizations and facilities in the country including multiple institutes at the National Institutes of health (NIH).  Axle  is seeking a highly ambitious, adaptable, structured, and detail oriented  Research Associate  to join our rare disease informatics team at Bethesda. The ideal candidate is willing to work between 30-40 hours per week and has the desire to have NIH listed on their resume. Currently, there are about 7,000-10,000 known rare diseases that affect people in the US, yet only a few hundred (less than 5%) have a treatment and even fewer a cure. A rare disease is defined in US law (Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983,[1] Rare Diseases Act (RDA) of 2002[2]) as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Most rare diseases affect far fewer patients than this, with most rare diseases affecting only a few hundreds to thousands of patients. Collectively, however, rare diseases are not rare at all, and in total are estimated to affect as many as 25-30 million patients in the US, making rare diseases a large public health consideration. The ORDR’s GARD information center was established in 2003 under a Congressional Mandate (RDA 2002), and is a federally funded program that has an essential role in the dissemination of public health information to rare disease researchers, clinicians, and patients that is freely accessible to the public. However, obtaining accurate, comprehensive, timely, and objective information on rare diseases is often difficult, given the large number of rare diseases, rapidly evolving science (especially related to genomics), diverse data sources, and inconsistent nomenclature and ontologies for rare disease classification, among other issues. Recently, GARD has been undergoing a re-envisioning and re-design based on a Neo4j knowledge graph database that integrates rare disease data from multiple sources to keep the information on ~6,000 different rare diseases in GARD up-to-date and useful to the patient and clinical research communities. Research tools, artificial intelligent models, data visualization and informatics infrastructure based on the knowledge graph database will be developed to support rare diseases research and clinical activities, and to answer rare disease research questions likely to inform rare disease research prioritization. [1] Orphan Drug Act of 1983, amended for prevalence 1984. Pub.L. 97-414 [2] Rare Diseases Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-280 Responsibilities : Work collaboratively with data scientists and application developers to develop informatics infrastructure and support for rare diseases research. Query the existing GARD knowledge graph database for rare diseases data, such as disease classification/ontologies coding (e.g., ICD 10), genetics, clinical characteristics/phenotypic information, diagnosis, and treatment, among others. Collect, quality check, process and integrate data from publicly available data and information resources. Develop a Neo4j database for data management. Develop APIs for user access to the existing knowledge graph database. Apply machine learning and/or natural language processing approaches for data mapping and knowledge extraction. Qualifications: Associate or Bachelor’s degree or enrolled in an accredited Associate or Bachelor’s degree program n Computer Science, Data Science, Bioinformatics, Information Systems or a related field. Good understanding of principles and concepts in database management and software development. Familiarity with Linux/Unix operating system. Familiarity with one or more programing languages, such as Python, Perl, Java etc. Experience in database management, web application and/or API development is preferred. Good understanding of principles and concepts of data mining. Experience in machine learning, deep learning and/or natural language processing is highly preferred. Experience in non-relational database, such as Neo4j, is highly preferred. Experience in containers (e.g. Docker, Singularity), version control (e.g. GitHub) and workflow management (e.g. Snakemake) is highly preferred.

A place where you can really contribute, and not just be another PR in the pipeline? Want to join a team of talented developers that enjoy working together and all have a say in how things are built? Looking for a small team you can join? A place where you can really contribute, and not just be another PR in the pipeline? Want to join a team of talented developers that enjoy working together and all have a say in how things are built? TLDR: Let's get to the point. You're our machine learning systems builder. You use technology to make training and deploying models as seamless as possible, because human time is much more expensive than machine time. Problem TLDR: A well functioning training and deployment environment accelerates the feedback loop and time-to-market for ML algorithms. We can't forget about observability either. Problem II: Deploying machine learning models in production requires thinking and working with non-deterministic output where the grittiness is in the data (potentially unversioned), not the code. This has inspired a new generation of platforms for deployment and ops but they are still a few years away from completely solving this problem space. We need someone who lives and breathes containerization, scaling, distributed systems and enjoys diving into algorithms as well, since optimizing an ML algorithms comes with nuanced tradeoffs around accuracy and performance. In this case performance can be ambiguous - it is training time, inference cost, inference time, or deployment time. You're here to help us define and balance these tradeoffs. Scope: You'll get to architect our system and lay the foundation for the future from both a technology and a system design perspective. Once you're done we'll have no problem seamlessly deploying multiple models a day, being made aware of drift as soon as it happens and falling back to old models when new ones unexpectedly fail. You'll work closely with our our Eng team to ensure that we optimize the design of the entire system and make good tradeoffs along the way. You'll also collaborate on the algorithm side, as it never hurt to have another collaborator, much in the same way that Random Forests outperform Decision Trees. Areas you're comfortable with: You're familiar with distributed systems and data processing frameworks such as Scala and Spark. You've used ML systems such as sklearn, tensorflow and/or pytorch. Yes, other languages/frameworks are fine as long as you can articulate how you've used the technology to solve similar problems. You don't mind writing SQL as necessary, but probably wouldn't operationalize parameterized notebooks, even if you could. Matrix multiplication is something you dream about. I'm only half kidding here as it underpins just about every aspect of modern ml and contains the keys to optimizing any algorithm using it. Designing an ML deployment system from scratch is something that excites you and you're able to clearly articulate the tradeoffs of different approaches and platforms. You've likely built some version of this before, or are at least intrigued by the idea of serverless inferencing. Philosophies: You strongly believe that action creates information. You want to work on a small team and have lots of responsibility. You look forward to being scrappy and enjoy overcoming challenges. You are willing to admit when you don't know something and bring in others to help you figure it out.  We are focused on building a diverse and inclusive workforce.

Interested in using Data Science to fight climate change at a scale where it will actually make a difference? Read on.  The Role  The specific mission of Indigo Carbon is to facilitate removing Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere through helping farmers transition to “regenerative” practices, which have been shown to draw carbon from the air into the soil as well as reduce emissions of things like Methane and Nitrous Oxide (this is often called Carbon Farming).

ONE MISSION. kwx is an integrated homeownership experience company that puts Keller Williams real estate agents at the center of its world. The spectrum of Keller Williams Realty Inc., Keller Williams Worldwide, Keller Mortgage, Keller Covered, Keller Offers and Keller Manage, provides agents with a seamless experience so they can offer their clients an integrated homeownership experience. Our technology, training and resources give agents more time to build meaningful client relationships. Every team member is a valued part of one team driven by one mission: to serve agents so they can serve their clients. We’re committed to listening, learning, and responding to our team members and to making kwx and its family of companies a truly great place to work. Working with kwx is a win-win for agents, their clients and our kwx team.  OUR HISTORY. In 1983, Keller Williams was a rebel upstart fueled by Gary Keller’s philosophy of “people helping people” and a win-win culture. Its enduring belief system, WI4C2TES (Win-win, Integrity, Customers, Commitment, Communication, Creativity, Teamwork, Trust, Equity, and Success) keeps them anchored in doing the right thing. The company started to fuel entrepreneurial agents’ success, so agents can serve their clients like no others in the industry.  As Keller Williams grew to a market-leading organization, its culture spread, as did the commitment to give agents the training and tools to grow their businesses and profits. Keller Williams’ proud past set a foundation for a bright future.  As time went on, Keller Williams expanded its offerings to support their agents. While it started with Keller Williams Realty, Inc., it soon expanded with Keller Williams Worldwide and then added supporting services including Keller Mortgage, Keller Covered, and Keller Offers. In 2020, the concept of One Co., integrating all companies for a homeownership experience, took hold and kwx was launched.  OUR LEADERSHIP.

Our shared passion and commitment to delivering world-class customer experiences at scale made the opportunity to learn and lead alongside Gary Keller a compelling opportunity,” Liebert said. “KW has the market share, the vision and leadership, and unwavering commitment to keep the agent at the center of the holistic homeownership experience.”  Liebert’s focus for the kwx leadership team is to integrate the organization into one team with one mission; grow, engage, and retain the largest, most inclusive agent base; build the best-in-class data strategy and tech platform; build ancillary services and create a superior client experience across the ecosystem.

We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud.  We stop them . We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. Detection@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We're a group of data professionals and security experts who build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception.   Countering bot fraud is not a situation where all the interesting data science problems have already been solved. Every week there are brand new challenges that require novel approaches.  - Austin L, Senior Data Scientist, MediaGuard The human we need for this role will work on  MediaGuard : our product for advertising platforms. MediaGuard provides real-time insight for ad-tech customers on which advertising opportunities are fraudulent bot-driven events.  What you'll do: Responsibilities Write ‘bot markers’ which consistently find fraud today, and work with other senior members of the team to develop flexible frameworks that can find the fraud of tomorrow. Become a domain expert in ad-tech and ad-serving, allowing you to develop the best strategies for marker development. Work with engineering managers to scope team OKRs and then deliver your own on time and on-spec. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to design new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Take a prominent role in building data-science toolsets that empower the whole team, especially more junior team members.  Who you are: Background and Skillset You’ve consistently delivered algorithmic software projects that demonstrably solved a business problem well. This means you can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use for a given goal, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, ad-tech work requires learning the intricacies of an infamously complex digital supply chain and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).Build analysis toolkits and platforms that empower our whole team to work more effectively. You know enough about how the internet/web works to give a rudimentary explanation of DNS / HTTP / JavaScript. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.  Our culture and benefits: Helping you do the best work of your life Focus Alongside the feel-good factor of knowing your work each day counters cyber-crime, we designed our cultural norms and work benefits to bring out your best. We strongly value deep work, so we practice company-wide Zoom-free Fridays . This provides a handy backdrop for a related initiative: ‘R&D Research Friday’: half a day each week isolated from day-to-day work for all our people to focus on trying new ideas, personal learning and career development. It’s backed financially too by a generous Learning & Development stipend. HUMAN's company-wide ""no meeting Fridays"" is like a breathe of fresh air after other jobs with the constant context switching of meetings interrupting one's flow. -  Adrian W, Principal Data Engineer.   Flexibility At HUMAN we’re fully committed to flexible working arrangements and making remote work...work. But what does this mean in practice? It means we supply you with a company Macbook Pro and generous home-office stipend, we pay for your mobile and internet bills and we recreate that shared-office-lunching vibe with expensable lunch delivery on Wednesdays. At our major hubs we also have physical spaces too, so you can get that in-person experience when it makes sense for you and your team-mates.",30+ days ago,

We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. DS@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception. The human we need for this role will work on  BotGuard : our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.  What you will do: Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product. Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work. Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you. Who you are: You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!). You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.  Benefits & Perks Unlimited PTO Private medical and dental insurance for all full-time employees Fully paid parental leave Learning & Development budget Phenomenal coaching from senior leaders and challenging development opportunities Monthly internet, phone bill, and meal stipend to support working remotely during COVID-19 Company-sponsored TalkSpace membership for you and your family  Life at HUMAN: Our HQ office is located in the heart of New York City. We are growing the company deliberately with a keen eye towards maintaining values that embody diversity, lifestyle, and career growth. We are doing substantial work, and we need people to join our mighty team. We are proud of our overwhelmingly positive presence on Glassdoor and Built in NYC. We have offices located in NYC, DC, Victoria, and London. We understand it takes a diverse team of passionate, curious, and creative people to solve the challenges involved in protecting the Internet. Our dynamic team of humans have incredible perspectives to share, just as we know you do, and we take great pride in being an equal opportunity workplace. We will ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation to participate in the job application or interview process, to perform crucial job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment.
