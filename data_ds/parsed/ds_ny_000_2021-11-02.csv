Setup necessary data processing pipelines to develop models that predict energy usage using weather, historical consumption data.   In your first 6 months, you will have:   Collaboratively worked with the engineering team to arrive at device control strategies that optimize for multiple objectives.  Developed and be actively refining the predictive and prescriptive models in use. These include predicting energy consumption and providing device operating schedules.  Identified learnings and insights to communicate with internal and external stakeholders, and worked with the engineering team to develop reports, dashboards and visualizations.  What we expect:  Know your data science.   You have in-depth experience with statistics and machine learning.  You demonstrate excellent analytical and modeling abilities (linear models, multivariate analysis, stochastic models, sampling methods).  You have experience implementing end-to-end data processing pipelines and developing algorithms.  Bonus: You are passionate about energy, and endlessly seeking better ways to manage it in homes and buildings. You are familiar with HVAC, occupancy, temperature, lighting and plug load data and how to analyze it.   Be a technologist.   You are able to write code to work with large datasets and across all stages, including extraction, cleaning/validation, analysis and interpretation. Experience with Python is a plus.  Be comfortable with a range of open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.  Be creative: you'll come up with new ideas based on your broad understanding of technological possibilities and city domain knowledge.   Solve problems, together.   You work well in cross functional teams. You are adept at communicating your ideas, responsive to new information, and value the input and ideas of technologists and non technologists alike.  You ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.  You are flexible to working on the team's most important problems.

We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud.  We stop them . We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. Detection@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We're a group of data professionals and security experts who build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception.   Countering bot fraud is not a situation where all the interesting data science problems have already been solved. Every week there are brand new challenges that require novel approaches.  - Austin L, Senior Data Scientist, MediaGuard The human we need for this role will work on  MediaGuard : our product for advertising platforms. MediaGuard provides real-time insight for ad-tech customers on which advertising opportunities are fraudulent bot-driven events.  What you'll do: Responsibilities Write ‘bot markers’ which consistently find fraud today, and work with other senior members of the team to develop flexible frameworks that can find the fraud of tomorrow. Become a domain expert in ad-tech and ad-serving, allowing you to develop the best strategies for marker development. Work with engineering managers to scope team OKRs and then deliver your own on time and on-spec. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to design new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Take a prominent role in building data-science toolsets that empower the whole team, especially more junior team members.  Who you are: Background and Skillset You’ve consistently delivered algorithmic software projects that demonstrably solved a business problem well. This means you can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use for a given goal, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, ad-tech work requires learning the intricacies of an infamously complex digital supply chain and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).Build analysis toolkits and platforms that empower our whole team to work more effectively. You know enough about how the internet/web works to give a rudimentary explanation of DNS / HTTP / JavaScript. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.  Our culture and benefits: Helping you do the best work of your life Focus Alongside the feel-good factor of knowing your work each day counters cyber-crime, we designed our cultural norms and work benefits to bring out your best. We strongly value deep work, so we practice company-wide Zoom-free Fridays . This provides a handy backdrop for a related initiative: ‘R&D Research Friday’: half a day each week isolated from day-to-day work for all our people to focus on trying new ideas, personal learning and career development. It’s backed financially too by a generous Learning & Development stipend. HUMAN's company-wide ""no meeting Fridays"" is like a breathe of fresh air after other jobs with the constant context switching of meetings interrupting one's flow. -  Adrian W, Principal Data Engineer.   Flexibility At HUMAN we’re fully committed to flexible working arrangements and making remote work...work. But what does this mean in practice?

Loved by customers and pop culture, we’ve consistently held the top spot for finance in the App Store for many years, seeing more engagement with millions of followers across social media in a day than most brands see in a year.

Our goal is to reduce the friction good customers have throughout our onboarding and identity verification process while making it harder for bad actors to fake and/or steal someone else’s identity.

For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible. For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments.

This requires meaningful collaboration with the platform team, the firmware team and even the finance team to prove or disprove new product ideas. Often the idea evolves from what was first proposed until it is a wholly new thing that gets shipped. No one here is ashamed to present their latest work, and you'll find yourself pitching ideas to others in the company, including to executives.   Beyond collaboration, we seek builders with the persistence to keep pushing. Because we spend our time making prototypes and testing brand new ideas on systems with a lot of moving parts, we are faced with failures every day. The only way to really make something work is to really dig into the reasons and understand why. We value the grit and persistence it takes to keep just trying.  About the role  Roku pioneered TV streaming and continues to innovate and lead the industry. The Roku Channel has us well-positioned to help shape the future of streaming. Continued success relies on investing in Data Science and diving deep into the economics of our business.   This role is right for you if you enjoy diving into messy data, cleaning it up, finding powerful insights, presenting them in a compelling way, developing models and then working closely with software engineers to automate this process, to prove it out at scale. You should also relish the ability to influence the direction of the team's strategic goals, question the inherent assumptions in our thinking, and defining the business objectives in an innovative and encouraging environment.   The ideal candidate will have endless curiosity and can pair a global mindset with locally relevant execution. You should be a gritty problem solver and self-starter who can drive programs with the product and commercial teams within Roku and across external strategic partner organizations. The successful candidate will display a balance of hard and soft skills, including the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.  What you'll be doing  Develop data science algorithms to improve user experience on Roku's platform.  Develop economic models (e.g., market design, pricing, program evaluation, and forecasting) to better understand the user experience on Roku's platform.  Run live experiments to prototype the improvements and prove their efficacy.  Dive into data, clean it up, and pull-out insights that can be used to improve system performance and present to senior leaders with recommendations on business actions.  Assist the development team with productization of successful algorithms, ensuring your work continues to drive value at scale.  Provide expert consultative assistance to other teams in the company, including data scientists working in other areas of Roku's stack and provide technical feedback on their econometric work.  Contribute to the technical vision of the Data Science team.  We're excited if you have  PhD Degree  6 yrs + of experience post PhD in Machine Learning, Operations Research, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, or similar quantitative field.  Experience in causal Machine Learning and experimentation.  Proven problem solving and analytical abilities.  Software development skills in Python, Java, Julia or Scala.  Proficiency with analysis tools such as Spark, R, MATLAB or similar.  Experience with TB or PB size datasets preferred.  Nice-to-have's include knowledge of user behavior in subscription and advertising-based video, auctions and/or advertising.  The Roku culture  Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.   We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
