Our product search engine, one of the most heavily used services in the world, indexes billions of products and serves hundreds of millions of customers world-wide. We are working on a new initiative to transform our search engine into a shopping engine that assists customers with their shopping missions. We’re looking at every aspect of search, from query understanding to front-end UX, ranking and relevance, indexing and tiering and asking how we can make big step improvements by applying advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This is a rare opportunity to develop cutting edge ML solutions and apply them to a search problem of this magnitude. Some exciting questions that we expect to answer over the next few years include: Can we deeply understand customer intent and personalize their search experience even when they type broad queries such as “dress” or “espresso machine”? Can we reduce the cost of serving customer queries on Amazon by orders of magnitude using ML to predict n-grams and tuples that many queries decompose into, apply expensive ranking functions offline to identify the most relevant products that match these terms, and index these for efficient online retrieval? We expect this to lead to exciting research at the intersection of systems and ML. Can we deeply understand the catalog to surface products that offer the most value to a customer? The challenge here is that the definition of value is subjective and personal, and therefore requires a deeper understanding of the customers intent as well as preferences. Can we use deep learning to transfer behavioral signals from frequently purchased products in the head to products in the tail where behavioral signals are sparse? The challenge here is the scale, and the fact that the head and torso contain only a small fraction of products while the tail contains an overwhelmingly large fraction of the products in the catalog. We have hired ML experts from leading research labs and academia to spearhead this effort. Our research leaders include Trishul Chilimbi (formerly MSR), Inderjit Dhillon (UT Austin) and S.V.N. (Vishy) Vishwanathan (formerly UC Santa Cruz). We are looking to hire Software Development Engineers (SDEs) and ML Applied Scientists at all levels, with experience in Search, Personalization, NLP, Systems, ML, DL and UI Design. Internship opportunities are also available throughout the year and we are flexible with duration and start dates. You will be working alongside world-class scientists and engineers to build next generation search systems and will be able to deploy your ML models into production. Our team is proud of its collaborative and open research environment, where long term thinking and risk taking are highly rewarded. We value academic collaborations and encourage our scientists and engineers to participate and publish in top conferences such as NIPS, ICML, KDD, SIGIR and WWW. Positions are available in Palo Alto, New York and Seattle. The Query Understanding Modeling team is responsible for developing and deploying state of the art machine learning and NLP models to extract semantic information on product search queries issued by millions of Amazon customers each day.

These maps were patchworks of military sketches, captain logs, and merchant updates, and over the centuries became more and more detailed. In an era of growing vehicle automation, having up-to-date and highly accurate maps is equally critical to ensuring safe vehicle operation both on the highway and on surface roads. Yet map building remains an extensive and highly manual process, meaning real-time high definition map updates often propagate through to the user with a delay of months or years from the date when they were collected, rendering them useless beyond limited driver-assist functions. It is time for a new paradigm. At TRI, our work is guided by a dedication to safety – in how we research, develop, and validate the performance of vehicle technology to benefit society. As a subsidiary of Toyota, TRI is fueled by a diverse and inclusive community of people who carry invaluable leadership, experience, and ideas from industry-leading companies. Over half of our technical team carries Ph.D. degrees. We’re continually searching for the world’s best talent ‒ people who are ready to define the new world of mobility with us! We strive to build a company that helps our people thrive, achieve work-life balance, and bring their best selves to work. At TRI, you will have the opportunity to enjoy the best of both worlds ‒ a fun start-up environment with forward-thinking people who enjoy solving tough problems and the financial backing to successfully achieve our goals. Come work with TRI if you’re interested in transforming mobility through designing safer cars, enabling the elderly to age in place, or designing alternative fuel sources. Start your impossible with us. The Automated Mapping Platform (AMP) team is responsible for developing a new high definition mapping cloud platform by integrating sensor data from vehicles and global imagery from satellites. It is an open software platform based on a contribution model: participating developers accept that vehicles deploying their application or software contribute anonymized sensor data to the platform. In return, every developer has easy, safe, open and sustainable access to high definition maps from across industries, fleets, and carmakers. One-stop-shop open APIs that allow developers to focus on building software. No need to worry about specific map implementations and maintenance, just pull down the data needed whenever it is needed. Updated maps will use mainstream camera data, the map update and building process will be increasingly automated, and satellite imagery will help build out a global road network where vehicles are not present in sufficient numbers to support a data pipeline. The role of the Data Fusion, Automated Mapping Platform (AMP) team is to process and fuse sensor and camera data from diverse vehicle sources with a high definition map developed using aerial and satellite imagery. This team will act as a bridge between the Automated Mapping Platform team at TRI-AD in Tokyo and the Localization and Mapping team at TRI. The expected output will be an accurate, scalable, semantic HD map of the world.  Responsibilities: Collaborate with other software engineers and research scientists to develop state-of-the-art localization, mapping and data fusion algorithms for autonomous vehicles. Support the development of large data sets and data pipelines for system training and evaluation. Develop high-quality software designs that allow for both high-performance and maintainable software Live and breathe the software practices that produce maintainable code, including automated testing, continuous integration, code style conformity, and code review. Create and improve services and systems to generate map data based on algorithms developed in house based on probe, aerial and satellite imagery Create services and products that serve world-scale data Involved in the process of maintaining the map database at nationwide/worldwide scale Educate those around you to the ways of good coding practices  Qualifications: Ph.D., M.S. or B.S. in Computer Science or a related field 2-8 years experience in related role Strong organizational and communication skills; great teammate.

These positions have an initial term of one year with the possibility of extension. The starting date is flexible, but no later than Fall 2022. Background The past two decades have witnessed natural disasters and extreme weather events that affect millions of lives. At the same time, the data volume from high-resolution climate models, satellite, in-situ and ground-based measurements have substantially increased to petabyte scales. These new and readily accessible datasets create the previously missing pipeline for scientific machine learning (ML), which in turn can improve our understanding and ability to predict extreme climate events. This project will develop deep latent variable models (LVMs) to discover hidden physical structures in high-dimensional, spatiotemporal data of extreme climate events such as droughts or heatwaves. Our project has three research aims: Aim 1: Discover hidden structures from climate extremes: apply novel deep LVMs, such as sequential variational autoencoders (VAEs) and tensor LVMs, to climate simulation data (and particularly to data composed of sparse observations). These LVMs will be designed to extract hidden low dimensional structures that are evolving in space and time. In turn, these hidden structures will be analyzed within the framework of causal transportability, so that predictions can be transferred from simulations to real-world observations in order to more accurately predict those extreme events. Aim 2: Incorporate physical principles, laws, and constraints into deep LVMs and the hidden structures that they discover. Neural networks will be trained by innovative methods that disentangle latent representations, provide weak supervision, and/or enforce equivariance. Aim 3: Quantify the uncertainty of predictions from deep LVMs. Specific goals are to (i) develop scalable techniques for Bayesian inference in deep LVM models, (ii) design pre-conditioners for Monte Carlo sampling procedures that handle long-tailed distributions, (iii) exploit hidden structures to accelerate methods for variational inference (VI), obtain more robust estimates, and improve statistical calibration, and (iv) investigate hybrid methods that combine Monte Carlo sampling and VI for more accurate posterior inference. Qualifications Ph.D. in computer science, physics, mathematics, engineering, or other related fields. Strong interests in machine learning and earth science, especially deep learning, dynamical systems, spatiotemporal statistics and optimization. Prior experience working with large-scale data sets. Papers in top machine learning conferences and/or scientific journals are a plus. Communication, presentation, writing, and teamwork skills.
