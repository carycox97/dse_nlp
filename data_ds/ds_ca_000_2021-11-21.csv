We will be reviewing applications on a rolling basis after the application deadline.  In a nutshell:  IDEO’s Research and Insights practice is in search of a Data Scientist who is well-versed in leveraging data science methods to improve understanding and aid in discovery. This person will be a member of our client-facing design teams that inform design, innovation, and strategy across a broad spectrum of projects and help to advance our practice in new approaches to understanding complex problems. This position shares much in common with our recently posted Computational Social Scientist / Data Scientists positions but is open to a wider array of fields outside of the social sciences.  Why is this role important for IDEO’s work?  An IDEO Data Scientist makes the biggest impact by seamlessly integrating data-enabled research methods into the wider design process. This person is able to seek out, explore, and analyze existing data sets, as well as create new ones, to generate insights for design.  They are responsible for structuring human-centered research and leading multidisciplinary internal and client teams through developing quantitative research activities and tools (algorithm based, sensor based, or whatever best captures the need), communicating complex technical concepts and results with clients and teams, discovering and leveraging novel public data sources, leveraging new data science methods and tools, and otherwise finding smart ways to augment qualitative research processes and insights with those that are data-enabled.  Experience and confidence working in interdisciplinary teams and a demonstrated ability to establish empathy with participants in a variety of contexts is advantageous.  We don’t expect all candidates to have deep experience in every aspect of what’s described below, but rather look to build a team that holds strength in all of these areas. So, if you are not sure if this is a good fit, please apply and we’d be excited to learn more about your experience!  Once here you will:  Center your work on people.  We go to work because we want to improve peoples’ lives through design. You’ll talk with and design alongside the people our designs affect, to develop a deep understanding of their needs and their context and develop solutions.  Partner with our clients.  It doesn’t matter how smart or creative our work is if it isn’t viable for our client’s business. You’ll get to know our clients’ values, strategy, and structure so that you can be an effective partner and make things happen.  Create tangible things, quickly.  One of our values is “talk less, do more” and our work often requires quick iteration over perfection. You’ll perform data analysis, create visualizations/simulations, and implement statistical/machine learning/optimization algorithms — learning new techniques and tools as necessary.  Shape data science at IDEO (and beyond!).  We believe that we have an opportunity to help conceive of a new way of practicing data science that improves business and society. You’ll explore approaches to practicing data science and share stories inside and outside of IDEO of what you’ve learned along the way.  Collaborate with inspiring colleagues.  We’re a passionate and creative community from a variety of backgrounds: anthropology, software development, graphic design, management, journalism, architecture, engineering, and more. You’ll learn from people from a uniquely broad variety of backgrounds and translate concepts between them.  Make connections.  We work in almost every industry on projects that range from the earliest stages of design and strategy to later phases of bringing new products and services to market. You’ll work to see patterns across these contexts, and apply what you’ve learned in one context to another.  What we’re looking for:  We’re looking for candidates who have:   Strong background in physical sciences, social sciences, digital humanities, or methods  Fluency at writing code to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data, as well as implementing algorithms in code (but don’t necessarily need to know about production software engineering)  Experience developing or leveraging creative new approaches to data analysis  Experience bringing data to life via visualizations and storytelling  Excellence in making data human, and sharing results simultaneously to those with and without deep quantitative experience   Through the interview process, we’ll be looking for evidence of these qualifications, but we don’t require any specific technical skills. We recognize these qualifications may be embodied in different ways — in fact, we get most excited by new ways people embody these that add something new to our team!  Likewise, we don’t have a specific requirement for degrees or years of work experience. However, we have observed that many of these qualifications are developed through full-time work experience (either as a data scientist or something else entirely), participation in community organizations, open-source software projects, graduate academic research, or something else.  What does IDEO offer you?  IDEO is a place unlike any other. It’s a place where you can solve diverse, complex challenges for our clients or the organization, alongside thoughtful, intelligent individuals who lead with curiosity, empathy, and optimism. Sure we work hard, but we also intentionally craft moments that allow our community to pause, create, and connect. We encourage our community to bring their whole selves to work, respect the need for work-life balance, and allow for autonomy in the design process and your career.  Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  At IDEO, we are committed to the work of advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion within our organization and in the world. We have a collective responsibility to design new systems. We have attempted to do so in some of our work, but we have not moved as quickly or as boldly as we should have. We cannot be successful until we re-examine our values, our relationships, and how we practice design itself.  We are committed to centering equity across IDEO in talent, training, community, design, and culture. A lot of work is being done to bring us closer to realizing this goal, but we’re still early in our learning journey towards understanding what it means to become an equitable organization. As we are continually working towards and providing attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion, we are looking for candidates who are committed to continuing this work with us.
