ID.me is a federally-certified identity provider at the highest standards NIST has set for consumer identity verification and login. ID.me is one of only four companies in the United States of America certified by the federal government to bind a legal identity to a digital login.

Data modelers are responsible for developing the data models. They transform business information into models by engaging with the business users and soliciting their requirements and iteratively refine the conceptual, logical, and physical data models. Data modelers work with application developers to determine the best representation for the data that supports that business process. Data modelers work with the business intelligence, artificial intelligence, data analysts and data science teams on modeling of the curated data and the common semantic layer. This role goes beyond the role of a typical application level ""data modeler"" in that it requires modeling from an ""enterprise perspective"" rather than from a single business perspective. Responsibilities include: Engage the business users to assess their information needs. Review the business process and conceptualize the entities that interoperate within the business process. Determine how the various entities are related and develop entity relationship diagrams that represent the connections among the entities. Identify each entity's characteristics and properties and ensure that the entities can be differentiated within the model. Develop a logical data model and validate the model to ensure that it serves the needs of the business application and its consumers. Transform the logical representation of the model into a physical representation and work with database administrators to instantiate and manage the data. Collaborate with the BI and Analytics teams on creating the optimized, reusable semantic model, complete with metadata and lineage information. Optimize the model to ensure predictable performance. Maintain the metadata - the ""data about the data"" describing the data model, its structure, and semantics. Recommend and establish standards, guidelines, and procedures for design and maintenance.
