Data plays a crucial role in Mighty’s opportunity to reshape the personal injury industry, and we have a unique and vast data set to leverage. You will be expected to drive strategic conversations with stakeholders about what we should measure and why as well as what decisions we should make and why. This role can be based our of our offices in New York, NY, Atlanta, GA, or be fully remote (US Only).  Your Mandate   Identify any and all opportunities to better leverage data to inform strategy.  Build and maintain core reporting for the company.  Deliver analyses needed to make better decisions in marketing, product development, and business strategy.  Set the foundation for a scaled data operation with more (future) specialization in each domain (e.g. marketing).  Own our data stack. We are currently using Fivetran for ingestion, dbt for Transformations, and BigQuery as our data warehouse; and we are open to trying new things.

A conversation with our recruiting team to go over some basic HR questions.  “On-site”  A case study interview to assess data exploration and visualization.  A data modeling and programming interview with an engineer.  A stakeholder alignment interview to assess cross-functional communication.  A conversation with our founder, Josh Schwadron.   Please note: we have this role posted under a few different titles as there is not universal alignment on titles in the data world. In the interest of transparency, here is how we think about the nuances of titles with regard to this role:   Analytics Engineer: this best captures a need for technical rigor; however, it may not clearly stress the importance of finding someone with a very strong business sense.  Data Analyst: this is perhaps the most “accurate,” but it may not articulate the technical requirements; we also fear there may be a stigma against this title as “data scientist” may appeal to more people.  Data Scientist: this is most likely resonant with the market, but will likely generate the most noise as it has become a pretty large bucket of different skills and interests.

We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore, we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud. We stop them. We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. DS@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception. The human we need for this role will work on  BotGuard : our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.  What you will do: Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product. Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work. Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you. Who you are: You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!). You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.  Benefits & Perks Unlimited PTO Private medical and dental insurance for all full-time employees Fully paid parental leave Learning & Development budget Phenomenal coaching from senior leaders and challenging development opportunities Monthly internet, phone bill, and meal stipend to support working remotely during COVID-19 Company-sponsored TalkSpace membership for you and your family  Life at HUMAN: Our HQ office is located in the heart of New York City. We are growing the company deliberately with a keen eye towards maintaining values that embody diversity, lifestyle, and career growth. We are doing substantial work, and we need people to join our mighty team. We are proud of our overwhelmingly positive presence on Glassdoor and Built in NYC. We have offices located in NYC, DC, Victoria, and London.

Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.  We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Nike, Airbnb, Slack, Samsung and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.  About The Role:  Do you want to help define what data means at Notion? As one of our first Data Scientists, you'll be instrumental in setting what our data strategy looks like as we grow the business, and then doing the hands on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or creating a model to deliver leads to the sales team, you'll absolutely be having impact on the direction of the business.

You'll build models to understand and predict things like user growth, future revenue, conversion, churn, and more.  You'll build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for making key decisions.  You'll communicate your findings with the rest of the company, and drive and verify change in our product and business (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)  Skills You'll Need to Bring:  You've spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with finance, business operations, and/or sales teams.  You are a SQL expert. You have no problem regularly leveraging window functions, UDFs, self-joins, and other complex SQL functions to accomplish your data analysis goals.  You have expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).  You know how to use statistical inference to drive product and business recommendations.  You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.  You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.  Nice to Haves:  You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.  You have experience building out data infrastructure that facilitates speed, reliability, and scalability.  You have prior experience with data-distributed tools (Scalding, Hadoop, Pig, etc) and statistical libraries.  You've worked with MRR/ARR at a SaaS company before, preferably in a B2B context.   Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we.

Every year, billions of dollars, hundreds of megatons of carbon and millions of person-hours are wasted because the companies who ship goods and the companies who carry them aren’t upfront about their needs and abilities. Our platform finds ways for buyers and sellers to contract binding commitments for plannable and predictable freight and allows those contracts to be traded when needs change. In time, Leaf will become the hub through which the trillion-dollar American freight market is managed. We are a team of experienced, smart, and mildly disagreeable troublemakers who like taking on unreasonably big challenges; we know how to build things, we’ve lived what’s broken in this industry, and we’re looking for bright, ambitious people to help us drag the transportation world kicking and screaming into the 21st century.

We are looking for data scientists who will:  Run Leaf’s internal engine to process incoming data and turn these into meaningful insights for our internal teams and customers Identify and quantify business value applying a diverse set of supply chain improvement levers Ensure high level of quality of results generated by Leaf’s algorithms  Provide feedback to the rest of the data science and engineering team to ensure continuous improvement of the internal data engine  Build visualizations to clearly communicate results and customer business value  Perform ad-hoc and on-demand analyses for internal stakeholders and customers  Prioritize your time and attention to maximize the impact of limited resources Who makes a good applied data scientist? You should be curious, relentless about asking questions until you understand something, and unafraid to acknowledge facts that don’t point in the direction you want them to. Be humble in the face of data, but tenacious in asserting the facts you know. Be willing to work with people you disagree with; be eager for criticism, and constantly searching for ways to do what you do better. Never be content with things the way they are, but don’t let the quest for something perfect prevent you from shipping something good. Experience in wider supply chain, especially truckload, is useful. You will need to be experienced with Python, and SQL as well as familiarity with the majority of the following:  Geospatial analysis  Pattern recognition  Clustering  Time series forecasting  Graph-theoretic techniques for network analysis We’re also a startup, priorities change all the time, something’s always on fire, and there’s twice as much work to do as hands to do it and new challenges surface constantly, and that you will need to be able to manage how you spend your time in the midst of conflicting priorities. #LI-remote Compensation Leaf offers a very comprehensive compensation package including competitive base salary, variable compensation and health benefits.
