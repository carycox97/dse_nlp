Sidewalk Labs is an urban innovation company that tackles cities' greatest challenges. We create products and solutions, invest in new companies, and help developers build more sustainable, innovative, and equitable places around the world. Our ambitious vision requires us to push ourselves beyond conventional thinking, and we work hard in pursuit of our mission. Our cross-disciplinary team consists of experts from real estate, urban planning, government, finance, technology, and engineering, among other backgrounds.  Our urban innovations include Delve (a generative design product that empowers real estate teams to design better, faster, with less risk), Mesa (an easy-install kit for commercial buildings that cuts energy costs, improves tenant comfort, and simplifies building operations), Pebble (a low-cost vehicle sensor to help manage parking and curb space), and Affordable Electrification (a new way to manage home energy use to meet a customer's monthly budget). We're also developing an offsite construction company that can deliver high-quality mass timber buildings for more sustainable living and working.  With the potential to radically improve quality of life in cities for all, our work is both exciting and complex. We are working to achieve something unprecedented — help us build it! What is the role?  Your role is to craft the control algorithms by which energy use in every home in America will be optimized for cost, comfort and local demand management.  Your models will involve numerous variables, including a dynamically changing price of power, unique comfort preferences per user (that must be learned), and a wide breadth of equipment to control in concert - some of which may have onboard control sequences that must be considered. Further, you must avoid every device in a home or neighborhood responding equivalently to the same cues and thereby creating a new inrush or spike in demand.  Your role is to figure out the priority and sequence of operations in a home to shift and shave load in order to meet a budget.  You will report to the Senior Product Manager on the team and work closely with the engineering team.  What you have to achieve:  In your first 3 months, you will have:   Developed strong relationships within the team and learn each member's role, skill set, and unique background.  A firm understanding of the product vision and what we have learned to date.  Become familiar with the available datasets and ML algorithms developed so far.  Analyzed home energy data to identify usage patterns and develop personas.  Setup necessary data processing pipelines to develop models that predict energy usage using weather, historical consumption data.   In your first 6 months, you will have:   Collaboratively worked with the engineering team to arrive at device control strategies that optimize for multiple objectives.  Developed and be actively refining the predictive and prescriptive models in use. These include predicting energy consumption and providing device operating schedules.  Identified learnings and insights to communicate with internal and external stakeholders, and worked with the engineering team to develop reports, dashboards and visualizations.  What we expect:  Know your data science.   You have in-depth experience with statistics and machine learning.  You demonstrate excellent analytical and modeling abilities (linear models, multivariate analysis, stochastic models, sampling methods).  You have experience implementing end-to-end data processing pipelines and developing algorithms.  Bonus: You are passionate about energy, and endlessly seeking better ways to manage it in homes and buildings. You are familiar with HVAC, occupancy, temperature, lighting and plug load data and how to analyze it.   Be a technologist.   You are able to write code to work with large datasets and across all stages, including extraction, cleaning/validation, analysis and interpretation. Experience with Python is a plus.  Be comfortable with a range of open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.  Be creative: you'll come up with new ideas based on your broad understanding of technological possibilities and city domain knowledge.   Solve problems, together.   You work well in cross functional teams. You are adept at communicating your ideas, responsive to new information, and value the input and ideas of technologists and non technologists alike.  You ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.  You are flexible to working on the team's most important problems.  You relish in the differences between people and how to develop products that work for everyone. You are passionate about making sustainability inclusive and equitable.
