Our comprehensive and data-driven virtual health platform is designed to help people, providers, employers, health plans, government organizations, and communities optimize individual and population-wide well-being by driving positive behavior change. Driven by our philosophy that we are altogether better, at Sharecare, we are committed to supporting each individual through the lens of their personal health and making high-quality care more accessible and affordable for everyone. To learn more, visit www.sharecare.com  Job Summary : The 2020 U.S. healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) crisis in the U.S. is estimated to cost $800 Billion, and the growth of FWA is forecast to outpace that of healthcare overall. Healthcare FWA in the U.S. is estimated to make up 20% of an ever-increasing $4.1 trillion healthcare industry, almost all of which goes undetected.  The volume, variety, and complexity of healthcare transactions have created a ""perfect storm"" for FWA. As the FWA problem in the U.S. grows, it increasingly endangers patients and their access to care.  Sharecare is working with Special Investigations Units for major U.S. payers who believe fraud alone in their organizations accounts for 10% of their total healthcare claims transaction volume. These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.  The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment: a flexible pre-payment solution that moves investigative efforts from post-payment to pre-payment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the pre-payment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by Sharecare. The combination of the maturity of AI technologies and increasing FWA makes this the perfect time for Sharecare.
