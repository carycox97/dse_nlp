ATD identifies, investigates, and develops high-performance computing methods, products, systems, and tools to support NOAA transforming these new technologies and capabilities into innovative and valuable forecast and analysis systems to help multiple users including the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) and their partners. NWS forecasters help protect life and property and enhance the economy by issuing forecasts (including outlooks, watches, and warnings) and providing impact-based decision support services (IDSS) to their core partners.  New developments in Artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to augment the existing suite of guidance available to NWS forecasters and their partners, by providing new types of forecast information, generating more skillful predictions, and/or generating more computationally efficient guidance. Visualization of AI information, including interactive visualizations, are essential to developing useful and usable AI for users, and developing such visualizations would be at the core of this position. This position will thus focus on developing visualizations for AI guidance for different weather, climate, and coastal hazards (severe convective, winter, tropical cyclones, coastal flooding, coastal fog).   Position Summary  The individual in this position will join the research team of the NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES; www.ai2es.org) to design, develop, and code visualizations and web-based interactive user interfaces of AI weather, climate, and coastal information in order to support the development of meaningful and trustworthy AI tools for forecasters.
