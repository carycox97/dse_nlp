https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9e8950e06a36982c&from=web&vjs=3,280,Applied Scientist,Afresh,"San Francisco, CA","Afresh is on a mission to reduce food waste and increase access to nutritious food globally by transforming the fresh food supply chain. Our solution is currently deployed in hundreds of grocery stores across the United States and is on track to reduce 30 million pounds of food waste per year with our existing customers alone. By 2021, we're aiming to reduce food waste by a quarter billion pounds per year.   The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.   We are looking for an Applied Scientist to lead the R&D work at Afresh. You will take your existing knowledge of forecasting, simulation, and stochastic optimization and apply it to the challenging and important problem of perishable inventory control. You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core replenishment system. This will include modeling consumer demand, item-level perishability, and complex multi-echelon supply chains. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.  What you will do:  You will work on improving the core models of our system: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and simulation. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges. You will model the complex problems of inventory decay, promotions, price elasticity, and inventory uncertainty, and implement solutions to multi-stage and multi-echelon inventory optimization problems.  In your first 3 months, you will acquire an encyclopedic knowledge of perishable inventory control and Afresh's core decision making problem. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and simulation tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting, ordering, or simulation models.  By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our core modeling system.  By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core system and led research into new product areas (warehouse level replenishment, production planning).  We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.  What skills and experience do you need?  5+ years of industrial or academic experience building systems that deal with large-scale decision making under uncertainty. Some possible prior research areas are inventory optimization, supply chain management, network optimization, forecasting, game theory, decision analysis, or stochastic and approximate dynamic programming.  Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English and easily translate business requirements into constrained optimization problems.  Ability to independently deliver high quality software implementations of your solutions in the Python data stack (numpy/torch/pandas/etc). Knowing Python before joining is not required.  PhD in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related quantitative field   Founded in 2017, Afresh is the first A.I.-powered fresh food optimization  platform  for grocery chains. We have partnered with several large grocers representing hundreds of stores and >$10B in revenue. Our cutting-edge AI  research  has been published in top journals (e.g., ICML). We’re backed by some of the top investors in grocery and tech including Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm), Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitch Fix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram), Food Retail Ventures, Maersk Growth, and Impact Engine. We are building a vibrant, diverse, and inclusive team that embodies our company’s values: proactivity, kindness, candor, and humility. We aspire to continually grow as individuals and as an organization to live these values and realize our mission. We earnestly believe that Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by employing novel technology—and to have a ton of fun along the way.

The data produced is extremely valuable as it generates a single source of truth for the physical world allowing for more veracity throughout the home improvement and insurance processes. We've found an incredibly strong product-market fit across exterior home improvement, insurance, and financial services. What's the secret sauce? Cutting edge technology, an exceptional culture, and a commitment to our values (Think. Do. Serve.).  With our team of investors, including Google Ventures and Menlo Ventures, HOVER is committed to continuing our success and facilitating growth. We believe there is strength in diversity so we hire skilled and passionate people from a wide variety of backgrounds.  Why HOVER wants you:  HOVER is looking for a data-driven leader with a knack for thinking outside the box. This role requires the ability to structure ambiguous problems, conduct meaningful analyses, and drive alignment across functions and within the Executive team. Your background includes deep experience leading cross functional Data Science initiatives that transform complex data into elegant stories, and ultimately, real impact, not just academic observations.  Our Data Science Team partners across the entire business, connecting efforts ranging from Product, Engineering, and Design to those in Sales, Marketing, Operations, and Finance, helping distil insight from the most complex of datasets and scenarios. Our business is growing quickly, and a large part of our success thus far has been using data to drive our most crucial decisions, and this is exactly where you come in.  You will contribute by:  You will be kick starting our small but budding Data Science Team, and you'll hit the ground running with a mix of People Management and Individual Contributor work, both mentoring your team through their autonomous projects and leading strategic analyses yourself.

An experienced story teller, you will be someone who non-data-literate coworkers seek out to help them break down challenging issues quantitatively, which sometimes might mean a quick back-of-the-envelope rough pass in 15 minutes, and other times might mean leading a 3 month cross functional project.  You'll be biased towards action, always excited to play devil's advocate, and you'll iterate until things are looking good, but you'll also know when things are 'good enough' and it's time to move your focus elsewhere. You'll know the size, shape, and scope of our product data better than anyone else, and this intuitive understanding of the numbers will be your superpower in group collaborations.  Example projects include:   How can we leverage our mobile usage data, financial data, and salesforce data to build a predictive model that alerts our Account Managers about the customers they need to engage with in a given month to drive growth or prevent churn?  How can we leverage our complex 3D Visualization usage data to help our Product team solve for friction users are facing? How can we help our Growth team improve in-app-messaging content to send to various clusters of user types?  How can we improve confidence in our forecasting for future product usage given the highly geographic seasonality we face across the country, with hail falling in certain areas at certain times while temperatures change in other ways in other places at other times? How can we leverage a diverse range of inputs to create a high confidence projection for future usage, such that we can be prepared to service it?  You will be among a team of Data Evangelists who care about fostering a culture of data driven decision making, and we will look to you to celebrate data, analytics, and insights across the company.

But a company doing their business taxes is still extremely manual, tedious, and just...painful. That's why neo.tax exists. We want to use modern technology to bring business taxes into the 21st century. We're starting with the R&D tax credit. Our first product simplifies the complex and difficult process of helping companies apply for the IRS R&D Tax Credit, which puts hundreds of thousands of dollars into each company's pocket. But this is only the start. We’re developing better accounting tools to automate more and more of the tax filing process. In the future, neo.tax will become the essential accounting software stack for small businesses. About the neo.tax team Our co-founders are a CPA with > 20 years of experience, a Stanford PhD in machine learning, and a former Intuit product manager. And along the way, we've picked up more people from engineering, product, design, sales, and taxes. But now it's time to level up. This is why we need to grow our team, and this is where you come in! If you are intrigued by what you read, keep reading below. P.S. We are a remote company, but prefer to hire in time zones that can overlap with our HQ in Mountain View, CA. About the Data Scientist role Automating taxes is a difficult but approachable problem with:  a large set of constraints,  a well-defined data model,  a clear objective function that must be optimized, and  a finite search space of possible solutions.  The potential impact is significant: make a painful small business problem disappear. Likely a better usage of data and ML than making newsfeeds more addicting or optimizing ad placement. We are looking for a data scientist to power our automated tax solution for small businesses, including start-ups. You will report to our Senior Data Scientist and work primarily as an individual contributor (IC). You will be required to collect, analyze, and interpret data for tax automation. We're looking for folks who appreciate the experimental nature of solving problems with data. For the lack of a better phrase, the candidate thinks about ""out of the box"" solutions, rather than immediately reaching for complex black box models that are as convoluted as the IRS tax code. The ideal candidate has exceptional skills in statistics, programming, and, while not required, a familiarity with software engineering concepts and tech stacks. Above all, you've got a hunger to learn what you need to solve an ages-old but ever-present, burdensome problem. Primary Responsibilities  Identify strengths and weaknesses in collected data  Assess the effectiveness and accuracy of data and data gathering techniques  Develop custom predictive models and algorithms  Research and implement appropriate data science algorithms and tools  Developing metrics to capture data and label quality  Select appropriate datasets and data representation methods  Perform statistical analysis and fine-tuning using test results  Develop A/B testing frameworks to evaluate model quality  Keep abreast of latest research in the field  Requirements  Proven experience as a Data Scientist or similar role  Deep knowledge of math, probability, statistics, and algorithms  Familiarity with statistical fundamentals (e.g., regressions, properties of distributions, hypothesis testing, etc.)  Familiarity with machine learning models (e.g., supervised vs. unsupervised learning, clustering, decision trees, neural networks)  Familiarity with ML training concepts, such as Active Learning bagging, bootstrapping, and online learning  Strong grasp of Python and typical data science libraries (e.g. Pandas and Numpy), SQL, and a proven ability to adapt to a different programming language if needed  Data visualization, dashboarding (Tableau, Retool, D3, etc.)  Understanding of data structures, data modeling, and software architecture  Experience integrating with and querying third-party APIs  Excellent communication skills and collaboration-first attitude  Outstanding analytical and problem-solving skills  At least two years of experience as an individual contributor (IC) in a data science or similar role  Bachelors in Data Science, Computer Science, Quantitative Social Sciences or similar fields; graduate degrees are a plus  Benefits Compensation will consist of the following elements:  A cash package in line with a well-funded, high-growth company.  Equity. Meaningful ownership in a company that has enormous potential.  Excellent medical, dental and vision benefits  401K  Unlimited PTO   neo.tax is committed to being an equal opportunity employer. neo.tax is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity.

In many cases this belief is powered by a three way value exchange between a publisher producing free content, a consumer consuming it and an advertiser paying the publisher for the chance to connect with its audience. The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher.  Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world's information and content free for everyone.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=771e98e4afeeb6ff&from=web&vjs=3,240,Senior Data Scientist,Span.IO,"San Francisco, CA","The Mission  The electrical grid was built to carry electricity unidirectionally from central fossil fuel plants to end consumers. As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to re-invent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.  To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.  Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.  The Role  We aim to establish the Span panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. Analytics and ML are essential tools to develop features for the smart, green, energy-efficient home of the future. Span's unique ability to monitor and control individual circuits opens up a new avenue for proactive whole-home management and equipment failure detection. As Senior Data Scientist, you will leverage your deep understanding of ML, modeling, and statistics to solve problems including anomaly detection, time series forecasting, and event prediction with the goal to optimally manage whole-home energy consumption, deliver meaningful insights to the customer, and notify them about a potential failure of equipment or hazards in their home.

Responsibilities  Lead the development of ML algorithms from the ground up which includes:   Gain knowledge in the relevant domain (e.g.common failure modes of appliances)   Feature engineering   Prototype new algorithms   Benchmark performance across large scale datasets   Use your experience with different machine learning frameworks to identify suitable tools for integration in Span's software platform   Integrate developed algorithms in our production code base with robust test coverage   Work with the firmware and software teams to design Span's edge model deployment framework; pick which ML framework Span should adopt   Proactively identify opportunities within Span that can benefit from data science analysis   Use fleet data to monitor algorithms in the field   Note: We're a startup, so while this list is broad, it's still just a start; you'll end up wearing many hats during your time at Span.  About You  Required Qualifications   Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, or a closely related field   4+ years' of professional experience with developing and implementing machine learning models to production   4+ years of Data Scientist experience   Deep understanding machine learning algorithms (anomaly/outlier detection in time series data, time series forecasting, clustering algorithms, probabilistic models)   Advanced Python skills, as well as familiarity with pandas and scikit-learn   Software design experience and ability to write clean, maintainable, and shippable production code   Experience working with SQL and data visualization tools   Extensive data modeling and data architecture skills   Knowledge and experience working within cloud computing environments such as AWS   Strong communication and interpersonal skills   Ability to understand and explain complex problems simply and effectively   Bonus Qualifications   Experience optimizing models for resource-constrained edge devices   Experience in data engineering   Domain-specific knowledge either through previous work, courses in college, or side projects   Life at Span  Span is a startup based in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco.
