Transparently documented communication:   we leave documented breadcrumbs in every decision we make so that those we collaborate with in the future have the necessary context, and can adequately support us in future decision making. Tiny, frequent, and constantly kept agreements : every single day, we break down initiatives into tiny agreements we make with our team that we are 100% certain we can keep. Strategy before story telling : before we build narratives for our vision and initiatives we prioritize the process of establishing what we’ll do next, why that is the correct thing to do next, and identify risks and trade-offs. Focus on good decision making and long-term results : we believe strongly that you ****are not the results of a single decision, nor do the results of a single decision deride your ability to make sound decisions. We are long, bullish, and team You— and focus on the results of consecutive intentional decisions. Systems thinking : we have seen most objective-result organizational behaviors result in fleeting meaningless goals. Rather than a goals-based mindset, we ask you to develop an outcomes-based and diagnostics-based mindset. Establish clear lines of responsibility:   Document what you're trying to accomplish, why you're trying to accomplish it, and who will be responsible for specific initiatives. Practice proactive accountability:   we ask you to practice introspection and proactively assume accountability for your decisions. Remove your ego: w hen your ego is involved you become so internally absorbed that it's difficult to level-up and see what's happening and how you're behaving. Check it at the door. Work cross functionally:   We don’t tolerate, support, or allow employees, teams, or departments to prioritize job descriptions over the success of the business. We are building a business. We are not here to build a pipeline, close opportunities, design products, or write code or algorithms. We are building a business. Work together to accomplish this outcome. Identify risks and assumptions:   be honest and self aware with yourself and your team about what you don’t know. Assess your risks. Identify what you need to learn.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=5e0849b3202788b4&from=web&vjs=3,170,Senior Data Scientist,eSpark Learning,Remote,"Overview  eSpark Learning puts fun and effective learning experiences in the hands of more than a million K-5 students around the USA, and can be found in 1-in-4 schools. After back to back years of 40+% revenue growth, we are looking to apply this success to our engineering organization and  double  our size in the next year so that we can further accelerate the growth of the business. In light of this, we are excited for senior data scientists to join the team who can have profound impact on the success of the company (as both contributors and leaders), and more fully realize their own potential by taking on responsibilities that align with their interests and passions.  The Role  As a Senior Data Scientist, you’ll join our engineering organization, reporting to the Director of Engineering, and help develop the practice and growth of data science across the company, in turn making the lives of teachers, students, principals, and other eSparkers better through your efforts. You’ll get your hands dirty with data to surface insights from our product, while also having the opportunity to help build out our data science function from the beginning, helping us define how we’ll conduct experiments, analyses, and other forms of quantitative research for years to come. We welcome candidates at the senior level or above, and will adapt title accordingly with experience.  There are three tenets all members of the team are expected to hold and embody:   We carry a growth mindset and drive our own development.  We believe that we do our best work when collaborating closely with others.  We care more deeply about the problems we’re solving than how they’re solved.   We believe that excitement to learn, a readiness to work together collaboratively, and good scientific and technical fundamentals are more important to success at eSpark than past experience with specific technologies or methodologies — we are always ready to pair and to train new staff on the methods we use. The applications our students and teachers use are built with Elm and Typescript on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend (all covered by tests), running on top of Docker and with data stored in MySQL and Redshift. In contrast, our data science technology is nascent, and actively being defined by the growing data functions at eSpark, including you.  Responsibilities  Use all of our data to generate insights across our chain-link of three stakeholders:  For students:  What behaviors are driving student learning? Why are certain learning resources more effective than others? What learning activities engage kids the most? The least? Are we serving all communities equitably?  For teachers:  What makes a teacher try eSpark with her class? What makes her stick around? How do eSpark usage and referrals spread within a school?  For administrators:  Which usage patterns in the classroom are predictive of a trial converting to a paid partnership? Do certain school attributes predict sales conversions?  Write software as needed to bridge the gap between the data we have and the data you need  Define and configure the tech stack for performant and reproducible analyses  Design and help build our experimentation platform  Support business goals by helping teachers find eSpark, sign up to use it in their classrooms, and advocate partnership to their administrators  Lead the experimental design around product and feature roll-outs  Participate in design and ideation around product and feature opportunities, using data to inform these decisions  Level up eSpark’s data science capabilities and knowledge across product, marketing, sales, and customer experience  Drive our understanding of the efficacy, equity, and fairness of our learning product for students of all backgrounds and circumstances  Participate in external research communities, and attend/publish work in academic and industry conferences like FaccT, COMPASS, WSDM, CIKM, KDD, AERA, NeurIPS, AIED, etc.   Benefits and Policies.  In addition to a competitive salary and stock options, eSpark offers full healthcare coverage (including vision, dental, and mental health benefits), generous vacation and parental leave policies. We are a fully-distributed company (circa March 2020) and provide benefits around outfitting your home-office arrangement, including your choice of technical equipment. We believe in work-life balance and respect nights and weekends.  The Interviews  The eSpark engineering team’s approach to interviewing is built on transparency, as we believe that everyone has a better, more productive experience when expectations are clear. For this role, we are looking for candidates who meet three specific criteria:   Self-sufficient scientist – You can design and implement analytic and experimental methods to answer important business questions independently, while leveraging the team for support.  Competent software engineer – You can write the code you need to gather and analyze the data for scientific work and develop and implement towards a vision for how this work can be done in a repeatable, reliable way into the future.  Capable strategic partner – You are quick to comprehend business and product context, allowing you to contribute to what we’re doing and why, with the ability to recognize and fill in the gaps as needed.   To learn about these three areas, and you in a general sense, we conduct three one-hour interviews with various teammates from eSpark, from engineering and beyond. We also ask for three references, to complete a full picture of you as a candidate. Written feedback or evaluations are also acceptable substitutes. We also recognize that not everyone has enjoyed a complete history of healthy working environments, and we are keen to work with you to identify appropriate individuals who can speak to your strengths and areas for growth.  For more context on our interview process, please refer to this document on Data Science Interviews at eSpark – What to Expect.  About eSpark  Vision.  Our vision is that every student, regardless of their circumstances or background, has the opportunity to set and realize an ambitious dream for themselves. Our mission is to re-imagine learning so it's student centered, enabling students to succeed in school and life.  Impact.  Our work makes a significant difference in students' lives. Independent testing data from public school districts across the country consistently show that students learn more in areas of personalized study with eSpark. One researcher from MIT, who evaluated an eSpark in Boston Public Schools, wrote: “I find strong positive, significant effects of eSpark for both math and English Language Arts (ELA). So the eSpark intervention, which is just 30 minutes a day, led to almost half the effect of a full year in a high performing charter school. I view these as very impressive gains. The findings made a substantial dent into the black-white achievement gap.”  Diversity.  At eSpark, we believe all people—adults and students alike—deserve respect for who they are. We work hard to make eSpark an environment in which everyone can thrive and succeed, supporting employees as individuals through people-centric management and as a company with our IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access) employee resource group. We believe it is critical that our team reflects the student populations we aim to serve.  Pandemic.  The 2020-2021 school year has been a time of unprecedented challenges for teachers, students, parents, and schools.  We believe — and have seen in last spring and fall — that eSpark’s personalized curriculum, made of fun and educational games and videos and adapted to each student; our commitment to providing teachers the tools and live support they need to support both remote and in-person learning; and our engaged team focused together on supporting educators and learners, can be a powerful help to teachers and to the students most at risk of falling behind during the pandemic.",30+ days ago,

With experts in software engineering, bioinformatics and program management, we focus on developing and applying technology tools and techniques to empower decision-making and accelerate the discovery in translational research. We work with some of the top research organizations and facilities in the country including multiple institutes at the National Institutes of health (NIH).  Axle  is seeking a highly ambitious, adaptable, structured, and detail oriented  Data Science Research Associate  to join our rare disease informatics team at Bethesda. The ideal candidate is willing to work between 30-40 hours per week and has the desire to have NIH listed on their resume. Currently, there are about 7,000-10,000 known rare diseases that affect people in the US, yet only a few hundred (less than 5%) have a treatment and even fewer a cure. A rare disease is defined in US law (Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983,[1] Rare Diseases Act (RDA) of 2002[2]) as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Most rare diseases affect far fewer patients than this, with most rare diseases affecting only a few hundreds to thousands of patients. Collectively, however, rare diseases are not rare at all, and in total are estimated to affect as many as 25-30 million patients in the US, making rare diseases a large public health consideration. The ORDR’s GARD information center was established in 2003 under a Congressional Mandate (RDA 2002), and is a federally funded program that has an essential role in the dissemination of public health information to rare disease researchers, clinicians, and patients that is freely accessible to the public. However, obtaining accurate, comprehensive, timely, and objective information on rare diseases is often difficult, given the large number of rare diseases, rapidly evolving science (especially related to genomics), diverse data sources, and inconsistent nomenclature and ontologies for rare disease classification, among other issues. Recently, GARD has been undergoing a re-envisioning and re-design based on a Neo4j knowledge graph database that integrates rare disease data from multiple sources to keep the information on ~6,000 different rare diseases in GARD up-to-date and useful to the patient and clinical research communities. Research tools, artificial intelligent models, data visualization and informatics infrastructure based on the knowledge graph database will be developed to support rare diseases research and clinical activities, and to answer rare disease research questions likely to inform rare disease research prioritization. [1] Orphan Drug Act of 1983, amended for prevalence 1984. Pub.L. 97-414 [2] Rare Diseases Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-280 Responsibilities : Work collaboratively with data scientists and application developers to develop informatics infrastructure and support for rare diseases research. Query the existing GARD knowledge graph database for rare diseases data, such as disease classification/ontologies coding (e.g., ICD 10), genetics, clinical characteristics/phenotypic information, diagnosis, and treatment, among others. Collect, quality check, process and integrate data from publicly available data and information resources. Develop a Neo4j database for data management. Develop APIs for user access to the existing knowledge graph database. Apply machine learning and/or natural language processing approaches for data mapping and knowledge extraction. Qualifications: Associate or Bachelor’s degree or enrolled in an accredited Associate or Bachelor’s degree program in Computer Science or Data Science. Good understanding of principles and concepts in database management and software development. Familiarity with Linux/Unix operating system. Familiarity with one or more programing languages, such as Python, Perl, Java etc. Experience in database management, web application and/or API development is preferred. Good understanding of principles and concepts of data mining. Experience in machine learning, deep learning and/or natural language processing is highly preferred. Experience in non-relational database, such as Neo4j, is highly preferred. Experience in containers (e.g. Docker, Singularity), version control (e.g. GitHub) and workflow management (e.g. Snakemake) is highly preferred.

We’re filling the unmet needs of people with chronic conditions that are invisible, neglected or stigmatized, starting with digestive disease.  Why digestive? Because an astonishing 70 million people in the US are affected—that’s twice the number with diabetes and more than many other chronic conditions combined. Unlike other chronic conditions, though, digestive diseases often go untreated or misdiagnosed…because of stigma.  At Vivante, we think it’s time to bring digestive health to the forefront while providing REAL solutions to the millions who are struggling and don’t know where to turn. Our health management ecosystem, GIThrive, empowers people—through brilliant technology and advanced science—to spend less time worrying about their digestive symptoms and more time living life. GIThrive is the first and only employer-sponsored program for digestive health.  We’re a young company, but our collective experience in clinical care, patient education, and consumer technology is unmatched.

Every year, billions of dollars, hundreds of megatons of carbon and millions of person-hours are wasted because the companies who ship goods and the companies who carry them aren’t upfront about their needs and abilities. Our platform finds ways for buyers and sellers to contract binding commitments for plannable and predictable freight and allows those contracts to be traded when needs change. In time, Leaf will become the hub through which the trillion-dollar American freight market is managed. We are a team of experienced, smart, and mildly disagreeable troublemakers who like taking on unreasonably big challenges; we know how to build things, we’ve lived what’s broken in this industry, and we’re looking for bright, ambitious people to help us drag the transportation world kicking and screaming into the 21st century. What does an applied data scientist do at Leaf? We ingest, clean and process large amounts of data from a variety of sources including shippers, carriers, 3PLs and 3rd party data providers. We are looking for data scientists who will:  Run Leaf’s internal engine to process incoming data and turn these into meaningful insights for our internal teams and customers Identify and quantify business value applying a diverse set of supply chain improvement levers Ensure high level of quality of results generated by Leaf’s algorithms  Provide feedback to the rest of the data science and engineering team to ensure continuous improvement of the internal data engine  Build visualizations to clearly communicate results and customer business value  Perform ad-hoc and on-demand analyses for internal stakeholders and customers  Prioritize your time and attention to maximize the impact of limited resources Who makes a good applied data scientist? You should be curious, relentless about asking questions until you understand something, and unafraid to acknowledge facts that don’t point in the direction you want them to. Be humble in the face of data, but tenacious in asserting the facts you know. Be willing to work with people you disagree with; be eager for criticism, and constantly searching for ways to do what you do better. Never be content with things the way they are, but don’t let the quest for something perfect prevent you from shipping something good. Experience in wider supply chain, especially truckload, is useful. You will need to be experienced with Python, and SQL as well as familiarity with the majority of the following:  Geospatial analysis  Pattern recognition  Clustering  Time series forecasting  Graph-theoretic techniques for network analysis We’re also a startup, priorities change all the time, something’s always on fire, and there’s twice as much work to do as hands to do it and new challenges surface constantly, and that you will need to be able to manage how you spend your time in the midst of conflicting priorities. #LI-remote Compensation Leaf offers a very comprehensive compensation package including competitive base salary, variable compensation and health benefits.  Leaf Logistics is an equal-opportunity employer and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=a1cf96c5fb53ee2f&from=web&vjs=3,50,"Data Scientist, BotGuard",Human Security,"New York, NY","At HUMAN, we know who’s real. We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore, we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud. We stop them. We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. DS@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception. The human we need for this role will work on  BotGuard : our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.  What you will do: Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product. Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work. Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you. Who you are: You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!). You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.  Benefits & Perks Unlimited PTO Private medical and dental insurance for all full-time employees Fully paid parental leave Learning & Development budget Phenomenal coaching from senior leaders and challenging development opportunities Monthly internet, phone bill, and meal stipend to support working remotely during COVID-19 Company-sponsored TalkSpace membership for you and your family  Life at HUMAN: Our HQ office is located in the heart of New York City.

We are doing substantial work, and we need people to join our mighty team. We are proud of our overwhelmingly positive presence on Glassdoor and Built in NYC. We have offices located in NYC, DC, Victoria, and London.
