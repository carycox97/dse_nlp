We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore, we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud. We stop them. We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. DS@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception. The human we need for this role will work on  BotGuard : our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.  What you will do: Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product. Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work. Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you. Who you are: You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!). You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.  Benefits & Perks Unlimited PTO Private medical and dental insurance for all full-time employees Fully paid parental leave Learning & Development budget Phenomenal coaching from senior leaders and challenging development opportunities Monthly internet, phone bill, and meal stipend to support working remotely during COVID-19 Company-sponsored TalkSpace membership for you and your family  Life at HUMAN: Our HQ office is located in the heart of New York City. We are growing the company deliberately with a keen eye towards maintaining values that embody diversity, lifestyle, and career growth. We are doing substantial work, and we need people to join our mighty team. We are proud of our overwhelmingly positive presence on Glassdoor and Built in NYC. We have offices located in NYC, DC, Victoria, and London.

The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.

We believe that true expertise in logistics cannot be automated and is incredibly valuable; however, we think software and technology can give logistics professionals  superpowers  to help provide shippers with the best service, and make everyone's lives easier.

We reject society’s stigma around personal injury and see a service that, when done well, delivers justice for millions of ordinary people who could not otherwise afford it. Fresh off our 2021 Series B from a top-tier VC, we’re building innovative solutions at the intersection of legal, financial, and health tech for the injured and everyone who supports them.  As a Senior Data Analyst at Mighty, you will be establishing our analytics function. Data plays a crucial role in Mighty’s opportunity to reshape the personal injury industry, and we have a unique and vast data set to leverage. You will be expected to drive strategic conversations with stakeholders about what we should measure and why as well as what decisions we should make and why. This role can be based our of our offices in New York, NY, Atlanta, GA, or be fully remote (US Only).  Your Mandate   Identify any and all opportunities to better leverage data to inform strategy.  Build and maintain core reporting for the company.  Deliver analyses needed to make better decisions in marketing, product development, and business strategy.  Set the foundation for a scaled data operation with more (future) specialization in each domain (e.g. marketing).  Own our data stack. We are currently using Fivetran for ingestion, dbt for Transformations, and BigQuery as our data warehouse; and we are open to trying new things. The most important component of the stack that we expect for you to own and lead is the transformation layer as it serves a foundational role in the architecture of our analytical capabilities.   Your Experience   4+ years working with business and product data to inform decision-making  A deep interest in how our business works, how decisions get made, and how data could help improve the quality of those decisions  Experience using the tools and techniques of “modern data stacks” Dashboarding and business intelligence (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Mode, etc.)  Data warehousing (e.g. BigQuery, Snowflake, RedShift, etc.)  Transformation and modeling (e.g. dbt)  Fluency in SQL  Ideally you have comfort with at least one programming language such as Python or R   Onboarding Plan   In the first 30 days you will learn our business and how we work. You will familiarize yourself with our data sets and our data stack.  In the first 60 days you will dive into discovery with stakeholders to begin to identify key metrics. Also, in this period, you will take ownership of our data stack and begin committing code in dbt as well as extending existing dashboards.  In the first 90 days you will have a long term vision and plan for how to leverage data at Mighty.   Hiring Process  The hiring process is a two way street! We want to find someone for whom Mighty is the perfect fit. Please ask us lots of questions to ensure you are learning what you need to learn about us. Here is an overview of how and what we will be assessing throughout the process:   A conversation with hiring manager, VP of Engineering, Aaron Gibralter  A simple SQL take home test to assess basic technical skills  A conversation with our recruiting team to go over some basic HR questions  Virtual Face-to-Face  A case study working session to assess data exploration and visualization ( please note there is an at-home preparation component to this interview )  An analytical interview to assess ability to identify business drivers and represent them with data and charts  A data modeling interview with an engineer  A stakeholder alignment interview to assess cross-functional communication  A conversation with our founder, Josh Schwadron   Please note: we have this role posted under a few different titles as there is not universal alignment on titles in the data world. In the interest of transparency, here is how we think about the nuances of titles with regard to this role:   Analytics Engineer: this best captures a need for technical rigor; however, it may not clearly stress the importance of finding someone with a very strong business sense.  Data Analyst: this is perhaps the most “accurate,” but it may not articulate the technical requirements; we also fear there may be a stigma against this title as “data scientist” may appeal to more people.  Data Scientist: this is most likely resonant with the market, but will likely generate the most noise as it has become a pretty large bucket of different skills and interests.   This article (https://www.abartholomew.com/writing/your-first-data-hire), written by Andrew Bartholomew, summarizes how we are thinking about this role.

It means that the best idea is the one you never saw coming. The thing that catches you so off guard that you can‘t look away. And the only path to genuinely unexpected works is through creativity. Not just what passes for creativity because it answers a brief, looks the part and helps everyone sleep at night. But creativity that is foreign, surprising and interesting enough to cause jaws to drop and sales to soar. It’s having the fresh perspective and raw energy to bring something into the world that no one’s ever seen before. We’re talking about the courage to shake things up and maybe even tear a few things down. And knowing that what most would call the finish line is where the real work starts. We believe in people, product, and profit, in that order. For us, people always come first. They’re the soul of our agency. It takes amazing folks to make amazing work. That’s why we make sure everyone who comes through the door is as great as the people who are already here.

You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. The best fit for the role is someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications. This is a full-time role. We are based in New York, but welcome remote applications from everywhere  Requirements: Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM). Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight. Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV. Experience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. Opinionated about writing robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs.
