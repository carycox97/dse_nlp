https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9c5da1df22344581&from=web&vjs=3,330,Data Science Manager,Sendwave,"Washington, DC","Who we are Sendwave is on a mission to make sending funds to loved ones as easy and affordable as sending a text. What makes us stand out in a sea of similar apps? We deeply care about the diasporas and communities we serve — and that comes with a sense of connection to the markets we operate in. We strive to make life better for everyone who touches our product. That means recognizing and honoring the human experience behind sending money. We do that by remaining fee-free in most of our markets and offering round-the-clock customer care.  Our app is currently available in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and parts of Europe, and sends funds to 19 receiving countries for over 500,000 users. We currently have a 4.6-star rating on Trustpilot — people put their faith in us to deliver their money quickly, securely, and affordably. And we're pretty darn proud of that.  How we work  What we're most proud of though is our brilliant, creative, and tenacious team. Our remote-first workplace means you'll be working with Sendwavers in Europe, Africa, South America, and the U.S. that all share a core set of Sendwave values. What exactly are those values? Glad you asked.   Prioritize fearlessly. There will always be more problems to solve and opportunities to pursue than we have the capacity for. We're not afraid to say no and are willing to let fires burn, knowing that to win we must discern and execute decisively on the vital few rather than the important many.  Take full ownership of the outcomes we're responsible for. Our job is not to do what we can to solve a problem. It's to ensure that problem is solved. If an attempt to solve a problem doesn't work, we seek an alternative. If we need help, we request it, and, if necessary, demand it.  Forge a diverse team and inclusive culture. We believe the challenges we're addressing will be best met by a truly global, diverse team, working together. We're not naive to the systemic bias and discrimination that make this easier said than done, so we check our egos, listen deeply, and measure progress towards making this a fundamental part of our success.  Maximize our rate of learning. We view projects as ever-evolving drafts and welcome opportunities to discover that what we had in mind won't work so we can move to an even better end state. Most importantly, we do this fast. The faster we run these loops — as a company and individuals — the faster we'll achieve our mission.  Embrace embarrassing honesty from ourselves and others. We function best when we're open and honest with one another — especially about our challenges and doubts. We lean into uncomfortable conversations and support our colleagues when they do the same.  Maximize energy, not time spent. We measure our own and others' contributions by objectives reached, not time spent. Living a full life outside of work is necessary for high achievement over the long term. Your key areas of focus :  If you've ever seen The Tinder Swindler , FYRE, or The Wizard of Lies you know fraud is an infinitely repeating social struggle that leaves the most vulnerable to pay the price. The Risk team at Sendwave builds and supports everything needed to aggregate the individual fraud cases and stop the scheme from ever being lucrative for the fraudster.  This includes integration of vendor tools, training new fraud/anomaly detection algorithms, supporting our risk operations teams, and improving our monitoring capabilities. You'll leverage your Data-to-Insights skills to develop accurate, targeted defenses that remove fraud from our platform.  In your first few months you'll:  Set KPIs and scope constraints for new modeling projects to decrease our information lag between fraud happening and us receiving feedback of its presence.  Develop heuristics to quickly fight fraud.  Identify missing tooling and suggested verification actions to help our risk representatives make sense of the system's decision to block and correctly assess the situation.  Evaluate and spec out integrations for new data sources for our fraud detection algorithms.  Diligently work to lower false-positive rates  Develop strategies to detect previously unseen patterns that may indicate a new fraud attack.  Develop strategies and tools to help less technical individuals develop fraud-fighting heuristics.  Automate the training and deployment of updated models.  Develop a new anomaly detection algorithm, helping us spot strange behavior before a chargeback occurs.  Help build experiments to evaluate new models, third-party data sources, and tooling.   We're building out a best-in-class Risk infrastructure that can enable us to grow and we're hoping to find an engineering manager that's excited to solve data-driven problems in an adversarial environment.

SQL Analytics (BigQuery, Redshift, PostgresSQL, Athena, etc)  Visualization Tools (matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, Looker, Tableau, Periscope, etc)  Bonus points if you:  You like building data driven systems and know SQL.  Have strong engineering fundamentals — you've built applications in python as well as trained model and are comfortable with supporting all layers of the stack.  Demonstrate tenacity and a willingness to go the distance to get something done. You don't mind doing things manually but automate at every opportunity.  Are inquisitive, intellectually curious and can make sense of complex systems or information.  Can work in a structured approach towards goals and pay attention to detail.  Can easily communicate with non-technical folks and translate their feedback into code.  Are comfortable defaulting to over-communication and overreaching when it comes to coordination.

WFIRST, conceived as a filled aperture, wide field, near infrared flagship-class observatory, was proposed to settle fundamental questions about the nature of dark energy and to complete the census of all possible types of exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy using wide-field imaging onto a very large, dense detector array. To accomplish this, the mission will accumulate 256 trillion pixel images at a rate of one every 15 minutes for analysis.  The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in early Spring of 2019, is conducting wide-field imaging of nearly the entire celestial sphere in search of exoplanets that eclipse their host star. Tiling the sky over a period of 2 years using four large detector arrays, TESS will recover about 2.5 million photometric lightcurves for each of its 26 sectors before moving on to a survey of the Galactic plane. The community, using a crude box-least squares method, is searching this vast trove for the faint signature of exoplanets - simply discarding other sources of stellar variability as noise.  These two missions and others under consideration have one thing in common – very large, very complex data sets replete with observatory systematics and elusive, tenuous astrophysical signals. Recognizing the significant challenge this raises for the science return of TESS, WFIRST and future survey missions, NASA seeks a post doctoral fellow with the necessary data science skills to formulate a systematic approach to extraction of science in the face of extremely high data rates or in large complex archives.  Examples of areas of interest include:  Machine learning for classification of astrophysical signals Artificial intelligence augmentation of spaceborne observatories to reduce data transmission rates Migration of science processing to cloud-based computing Development of highly accessible data bases with in situ computing Graphics Processing Unit acceleration of scientific data processing  Candidates need not have a strong background in astronomy or physics to apply.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=eb6643b8c1865765&from=web&vjs=3,390,Machine Learning for Data Assimilation,National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),"Greenbelt, MD","Organization  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Reference Code  0213-NPP-JUL22-GSFC-EarthSci Application Deadline  7/1/2022 6:00:00 PM Eastern Time Zone Description  In support of NASA’s Earth science missions, the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) maintains the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) weather prediction model. Multiple times a day, GEOS combines millions of real-time observations from around the globe with the billions of variables output from the model to produce the best guess of the atmospheric state. This monumental data science problem, known as data assimilation, presents a number of challenges: how to optimally combine all of the data in a physically sensible way, and how to assess the value of the information we have. There are numerous approaches to data assimilation, but adjoint-based techniques are used in the world’s leading forecast systems. As such, GMAO maintains an adjoint version of the GEOS model and uses it in several important data assimilation applications. However, adjoint model development can be a difficult process. It relies on a linearization of the model equations, many of which are nonlinear. In addition, the nonlinear model development progresses rapidly, and keeping the adjoint version in sync can be challenging; adjoint models must be extremely efficient, and automated generation (differentiation) tools are less helpful in this respect. Recently, two areas or research have arisen that can be applied to adjoint development to make it more streamlined. First is machine learning. In a machine learning approach, a neural network is trained to emulate the behavior of some component of the GEOS model. Once trained, the adjoint of that emulation would be readily available due to the inherent use of adjoints in neural network methodology. Neural network emulations are typically much faster than the model they emulate and can be trained again with relative ease as the underlying model changes. This makes them an appealing alternative for generating adjoint models. The second technology is the Local Ensemble Tangent Linear Models (LETLM), where an ensemble of model forecasts is used to generate the adjoint version of the model. Like a machine learning approach, this would eliminate the need to develop the adjoint model explicitly and would account for nonlinearity in the underlying system. A novel approach to adjoint development harnessing these techniques has the potential to unleash a new era of adjoint-based data assimilation and advance weather forecasting.

Do you enjoy the challenge of ensuring that the right information is delivered to the right people at the right time to drive the business? Do you thrive in a fast-paced environment that presents new challenges every day that also nurtures talent and emphasizes collaboration?        The systems engineering group in MITRE’s corporate information technology division is seeking a highly motivated Data Modeler to take on the challenge of transforming how MITRE manages and shares our critical information assets. In this role you will work directly with senior management and thought leaders from across the company on MITRE’s most critical corporate IT initiatives        Data models provide a graphical representation of the entities that interoperate within the organization in support of the organization business processes and the relationships among these entities. Data modelers are responsible for developing the data models. They transform business information into models by engaging with the business users and soliciting their requirements and iteratively refine the conceptual, logical, and physical data models. Data modelers work with application developers to determine the best representation for the data that supports that business process. Data modelers work with the business intelligence, artificial intelligence, data analysts and data science teams on modeling of the curated data and the common semantic layer. This role goes beyond the role of a typical application level ""data modeler"" in that it requires modeling from an ""enterprise perspective"" rather than from a single business perspective.        Responsibilities include:         Engage the business users to assess their information needs.      Review the business process and conceptualize the entities that interoperate within the business process.      Determine how the various entities are related and develop entity relationship diagrams that represent the connections among the entities.      Identify each entity's characteristics and properties and ensure that the entities can be differentiated within the model.      Develop a logical data model and validate the model to ensure that it serves the needs of the business application and its consumers.      Transform the logical representation of the model into a physical representation and work with database administrators to instantiate and manage the data.      Collaborate with the BI and Analytics teams on creating the optimized, reusable semantic model, complete with metadata and lineage information.      Optimize the model to ensure predictable performance.      Maintain the metadata - the ""data about the data"" describing the data model, its structure, and semantics.      Recommend and establish standards, guidelines, and procedures for design and maintenance.
