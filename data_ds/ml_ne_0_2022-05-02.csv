Accessibility remains a top priority in UNO’s mission and vision. Today, the campus is known for its student-centered environment, its community engagement, and its dedication to embracing students from all types of backgrounds.

Why            UNO           ?                             The University of Nebraska at Omaha is fueled by its historical ties to Omaha. As the first municipal university in Omaha, the early founders’ goal was to make higher education accessible and affordable for the city’s residents.

Accessibility remains a top priority in UNO’s mission and vision. Today, the campus is known for its student-centered environment, its community engagement, and its dedication to embracing students from all types of backgrounds. UNO’s ranking as the 2020 Best College for LGBTQ+ Students In Nebraska reflects a commitment to the Maverick values of access, inclusion and diversity that make UNO a welcoming campus community, evidenced by the numerous resources and support services offered by the university.                              The campus has built strong partnerships with local business, education, government, arts, and civic organizations in the city.
