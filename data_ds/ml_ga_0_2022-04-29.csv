https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=545b6a270cd699d1&from=web&vjs=3,20,"Machine Learning Engineer, Commerce ML",Block,"Atlanta, GA","  Company Description    Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.    Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.     There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.         Job Description    The Commerce ML team applies machine learning to improve the experience of our sellers and help automate the running of their business. In particular, the team focuses on shipping ML-driven features for Square for Retail, in areas such as helping offline sellers get online more easily, setting their catalogs up more quickly, and optimizing their inventory levels. To develop each feature, we pay close attention to four key and interdependent aspects: Design, Modeling, Engineering, and Analytics. Design is concerned about the usefulness and remarkability of the feature, and thus cares about the overall functionality, ease of use, and aesthetics of the experience. Modeling is concerned about the accuracy of the ML model, and thus cares about the training data, the features and performance of the model, and —crucially for a customer-facing product— how the application behaves in the face of the mistakes the model will inevitably make (e.g., false positives, false negatives, lack of predictions above a certain confidence). Engineering in turn is concerned about running the ML model at scale, and thus cares about the latency, throughput, and robustness of the inferencing service. Finally, Analytics is concerned about the adoption of the feature, and thus cares about the instrumentation to capture detailed usage and acceptance rate, the definition of success metrics and dashboards, and the collection of feedback in a manner that the ML model can learn from, and thus keep improving over time.     If developing customer-facing ML-driven product features fascinates you, we are looking for an ML modeler to join the team and help deliver the future of Square for Retail!     You will...         Play a key role in developing ML-driven product features that help millions of Sellers worldwide      Develop data pipelines, engineer features, and train ML models for NLP, computer vision, and other use cases      Build and maintain low-latency, high-RPS ML services      Work cross-collaboratively with data scientists, product managers, and designers to iterate on and define product functionality and UX design      Partner closely with platform and product teams to review engineering designs and provide architectural guidance              Qualifications    You have…         Excellent understanding of ML modeling techniques, from ""classic"" statistical classifiers to ""modern"" deep learning and transformer approaches      Experience applying ML to solving complex business problems      Good command of engineering fundamentals      Experience with NLP and/or computer vision use cases a plus      Motivation to build beautiful, intuitive products      Innate curiosity, and a desire to learn and teach      Empathy for your customers and colleagues      Eagerness to share your own ideas, and openness to those of others        Languages and tech frameworks we use (and teach)...
