We build popular software that uses machine learning to improve image quality for photographers and videographers. Hundreds of thousands of paid customers use our products, from amateur photographers to major movie studios.                  While our impact is growing fast, our team size is still very small (around ~20 people). We're looking for a mission-driven and passionate technical recruiter to take ownership of our sourcing strategy and recruiting engine to supercharge our growth. You'll work directly alongside the CEO every day to define and execute our recruiting strategy. This is a great opportunity for a super smart, scrappy, and high trajectory individual to help build our rocket ship right from the launchpad.                    About us:             In 2018 we were the first to use machine learning to improve image quality (covered by Fast Company, The Verge, Engadget, Mashable, BBC, and more). We have an obsessive customer base that is growing rapidly.  We have extreme growth and opportunity for impact: $3M revenue in 2018 to $20M+ in 2021 with no end in sight.  We have a huge total addressable market. How useful to how many people would a real-life version of CSI's ""Enhance"" be? That's what we're building, and we're better than anyone else at it.  We fanatically embrace ownership, autonomy, and craftsmanship - and do everything we can to remove unnecessary process, hierarchy, and micro-management.                          About you:             You're the same kind of person that you'll be looking for: high trajectory, stellar work ethic, takes massive pride and ownership in your work.  Effective approach to sourcing past simple boolean searches on LinkedIn. (What's one thing you do differently from typical recruiters?)  You're execution-focused and obsessed with making the details great  You're a great written and verbal communicator  Preferred: you've worked in tech as an internal recruiter before                         This is a great opportunity for the perfect person to help us accelerate even further by building our recruiting team from the ground up. We offer strong base salary plus significant ownership that scales with the company's impact. We're also proud to offer 100% covered medical/dental/vision for employees, 15 days annual PTO plus holidays, and 401k matching. This is a full-time onsite role in Dallas, TX.         ",1 day ago,

What is cloud computing? Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, companies can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from AWS. AWS offers over 175 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 77 Availability Zones across 24 geographic regions. AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world - including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs. AWS is committed to running our business in the most environmentally friendly way possible, and our scale allows us to achieve higher resource utilization and energy efficiency than the typical on-premises data center.

We build software that uses machine learning to improve image quality for over a million paid customers, from amateur photographers to major movie studios. We've entering an explosive growth stage and have been covered by Fast Company, The Verge, Engadget, Mashable, BBC, and more.                  We’re looking for someone to lead software engineering across our company. This role heads one of our most important departments and reports directly to the CEO. The primary responsibility is to develop an elite engineering organization to enable constant and reliable delivery of our desktop software products.                    Our story so far:             In 2018 we were the first to use machine learning to improve image quality (covered by Fast Company, The Verge, Engadget, Mashable, BBC, and more). We have an obsessive customer base that is growing rapidly.  We have extreme growth and opportunity for impact: $3M revenue in 2018 to $25M in 2021 with no end in sight.  We have a huge total addressable market. How useful to how many people would a real-life version of CSI's ""Enhance"" be? That's what we're building, and we're better than anyone else at it.  We fanatically embrace ownership and autonomy, and do everything we can to remove unnecessary process, hierarchy, and micro-management.                          Core responsibilities             Set and maintain a high standard of execution for product development by leading by example.  Develop a world-class software engineering culture and processes to support it.  Find and attract talented engineers, help remove their blockers, and develop them into a world-class team.                         We’re looking for a pretty specific person for this role - someone with shipping mentality, servant leadership, and an unusually strong work ethic. Ideally you have led engineering before and have grown a team from 0-5 engineers to around 15-25, and are opinionated about the best way to do it again. We've also found that former product or engineering founders do great at our company. The most impactful skills are great verbal / written communication, good engineering best practices, and good product sense. We use C++, QML, and JS for app development and OpenGL, OpenCV, Tensorflow for the engine.                  This is a great opportunity for the perfect person to build our engineering organization from the ground up as we go through explosive users and revenue growth. Your compensation will be tied directly to the performance of the company. We’re also proud to offer 100% covered platinum-level medical/dental/vision for employees, 15 days annual PTO plus holiday, and 401k matching. Because of the tight-knit nature of our company and mission, our product and leadership teams are fully colocated in our Dallas, TX office.           ",1 day ago,

It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.  We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.

This algorithm programs neural networks into our on-chip flash memory, and must program 10-100M flash transistors to greater than 128 levels. This is factor of 8 greater than state-of-the-art flash storage devices and is required to complete in under a minute in typical use cases. To achieve this, several innovative DSP-related concepts are employed. This algorithm is a significant piece of differentiating IP and one of the key enablers of analog compute.                  In addition to driving the development of the programming algorithm, this role will also support our analog compute technology at the DSP/platform level. This includes development on our Python data collection frameworks, continued development of our silicon model for neural network development, and development of faster and more accurate production screening approaches. Mythic's analog compute hardware is a massive integration of analog and digital components on a single chip, with multiple cascaded stages of digital and analog. Therefore, for certain platform and software work, knowledge of DSP, statistics, RF baseband, or similar fields matches very well with the work.                  This is a very high-visibility role within Mythic. Through modeling and large-scale data collection and analysis of silicon, this role will drive the development of critical production firmware and will also help set specifications for future hardware platforms. This role will also get an opportunity to learn a lot of about artificial intelligence and neural networks through collaboration with our software and research team. In all, this role does not require hardware design experience or artificial intelligence experience, and will be a great opportunity to gain valuable knowledge in both areas.                  This role is not location-specific. However, candidates will be expected to keep working hours in line with either Pacific or Central Time.                     Here's what you will do             Ownership of:  Current and future generations of our flash programming algorithm from concept to production deployment.  Additionally the role will work with other team members and will contribute to:  Building approaches for debugging analog compute systems in the field and in lab settings  Developing faster and more effective screening approaches for product test engineering.  Refining our statistical compute model of the hardware, an essential tool for both software and hardware development  Building frameworks for large scale data capture and analysis of our hardware                          Here's the background we hope you will have             At least 5 years experience in production DSP or RF baseband engineering (< 3 years if Ph.D or M.S.)  Strong familiarity with production Python coding, including object oriented and/or functional programming  Strong familiarity with core DSP concepts, including frequency domain analysis, filtering, and signal processing statistics.  Strong familiarity with Numpy (or experience with Numpy and strong familiarity with MATLAB for DSP).  Track record of debugging production DSP systems.  Understanding of linear algebra concepts, including matrix math and linear regression.  Comfort with large-scale collection and processing of signals.  Performance analysis of software systems and algorithms.  Experience in building data reports and visualization dashboards  Familiarity with Linux environments for scripting of large-scale networked data collection                          The following would be nice to have, but is not required             Ph.D or M.S. in digital signal processing or digital RF/baseband systems.  Experience with AI and deep neural networks  Embedded firmware development  Optimizing performance of real-time code.  Understanding of embedded multi-core processors                          #LI-Remote                   At Mythic, we pride ourselves in creating a culture where all employees feel valued and appreciated for the diverse perspectives and backgrounds they bring to the team. We aim to hire smart people, give them the resources they need to do their job well, and then leave the rest up to them. We celebrate individual differences and encourage people to be comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work.

Always Authentic : We keep it real. We believe in constructive honesty in all facets of our work. Whether it is our customers, prospective customers, partners, or fellow Hyperproofers we state the facts versus telling people what they want to hear. Each of us are who we are regardless of the context. No playing politics and no BS. Just healthy, constructive, reality-based discourse.                      We Keep Our Promises : We make every effort to meet our commitments. If we’re unable to meet a commitment, we let others know right away. We consistently create methods to prioritize our work so we can meet our commitments. We commit ONLY when we intend to follow through, not as a tactic to move the discussion forward.                      Customer Obsessed : We start with customer needs and work backwards. We seek to collect customer data (when it is available) before making decisions. We regularly and proactively seek customer feedback on designs, offers and other work products.                      Measure and Adjust : We take every opportunity to define, publish and update metrics. We seek to measure and improve as we continue to invest in activities. We are willing to propose modifications when the data demands it.                      Continuously Innovate : We seek to understand before we act. We challenge prevailing assumptions and suggest better approaches. We embrace change. We often revisit previous trade-offs and apply new innovations.                      Make Decisions We Are Proud Of : We only make decisions we would be willing to share with our parents. We speak out when we see others making decisions that compromise our values. We act like everyone is watching even when they are not.                      Simplify : Our code, written and verbal communication are pithy and focused. We research and iterate, thus doing “the hard work of being simple”. We revisit our previous work to simplify it as it grows. We simplify by staying focused and not over-extending / under-delivering.                      Win As a Team : We prioritize succeeding as a team and an organization over-optimizing for individual objectives. We provide timely feedback to others when feedback is solicited. We are intentional about fostering an inclusive work environment. We speak our minds respectfully so we can be heard by others. We demonstrate listener empathy so others feel safe sharing their honest feedback. As leaders, we don’t dictate. Instead, we empower our team to do their best work. We recognize others’ contributions in a timely manner.                      Location                 You must be currently authorized to work in the United States on a full-time basis.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=94eea5a1f65d039f&from=web&vjs=3,350,Technical Product Manager,Plus One Robotics,"San Antonio, TX","  Job Location      This position will be on-site in either San Antonio, TX or Boulder, CO*     Summary Do you love robots and product? Look no further.   Plus One Robotics stands at the cusp of a new era in automated warehouses: our solutions are designed to alleviate labor shortages while improving throughput as consumer online spending continues to explode. Our robots are used by the biggest players in parcel shipping. If boxes have ever piled up outside your doorstep, there’s a good chance our robots have touched at least one of them.   We seek a driven and intellectually voracious product manager who is equally comfortable with engineers and business executives to build out the platform undergirding our customer-facing products to accelerate the growth of the company.   The work will be challenging but it’ll be a chapter of your career that will make for a great story.   About the Job   Essential Functions   For those who don't mind a steep learning curve, the right person for this role will enjoy wide latitude and broad scope:   Milestone delivery:   Manage the multi-team development of a robotic platform by understanding business requirements, anticipating bottlenecks and dependencies, managing changes, removing roadblocks, mitigating risks, and building consensus with cross-functional stakeholders. Roadmap design:   Identify, prioritize, and advocate for the most impactful opportunities to improve the efficiency and quality of longer-term customer-facing product development. Data-driven decisions:   Define and assess metrics to guide platform development. Engineering translation:   Collaborate with engineers and customer-facing product managers to write technical requirements docs to help engineers understand product specifications. Foundation building:   Make tradeoffs between satisfying near-term needs while building a platform that can support growth at scale across many applications.   Qualifications   Qualifications   Our customers will learn about how best to incorporate new technology into their physical spaces while deriving immediate concrete value from their purchase of the robot. You will pull out all the stops to ensure the success of our customers — some of the most prominent brands in the country — and use their feedback to further improve our product.   You’re the ideal candidate if:  You’re responsive and responsible:   you commit to deadlines and err on the side of over-communication. You’re analytical and data-driven:   p-values and pivot tables are old buddies with whom you don’t mind spending an afternoon distilling data into an insightful story. You’re versatile and goal-oriented:   you can drive various teams with competing priorities. You’re collaborative and results-oriented:   you understand both that you need to crack a few eggs to make an omelet but also that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. You have an eye for detail and are an excellent writer:   you notice when someone writes “Pick One” instead of “PickOne” and it bothers you when others don’t get it right. You're self-sufficient and whip-smart:   you get things done and learn what you don’t know. You’re organized:   you can juggle and make progress on multiple initiatives simultaneously. You’re empathetic and user-focused:   you understand that you may not be the target audience and you are unrelenting in holding a high bar for the user experience. You’re creative and a strategic thinker:   you understand and can shape the team around the right level of process while displaying excellent judgment to achieve both short-term and long-term goals. You value first-hand on-the-ground experience and not just taking someone else’s word for it: you’re happy to observe and take notes on the robot picking up packages all day and jump on a plane as needed to fully internalize customer workflows. You’re a technophile:   you don’t have to be a former engineer, but you’ve dabbled in code and are eager to brush up your experience in unfamiliar fields, whether it’s hardware, perception, machine learning, or others. You’re high-integrity, ambitious, and play “infinite” games:   you understand that careers are long, that people and values come first, and that there's a difference between being liked and being respected. You’re passionate and clear-eyed when it comes to robots:   you understand that there’s a gap between technological reality and media-driven expectations and are excited about the opportunity to move the industry forward by whatever means necessary, even if it isn’t glamorous.   Desired Education and Experience   Even if you don’t check all the boxes, feel free to include a short paragraph explaining why you would be the best candidate regardless.   Bachelor's degree in a technical field (e.g. computer science, engineering, physics, math, etc.) or equivalent practical experience 5 years of experience in product management, especially in enterprise platforms or robotics Experience in one or more of the following:   cloud infrastructure, on-prem enterprise software, machine learning, developer APIs, warehouse logistics Working knowledge of best practices in Agile, engineering processes, and preparing a startup for growth   Additional Eligibility Qualifications   Must have a valid passport.
