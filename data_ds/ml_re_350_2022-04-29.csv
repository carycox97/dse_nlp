Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Verification Engine, the backbone of all our products that protect enterprises from sophisticated bots. Today we verify the humanity of more than 15 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms across the internet.                  Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to helping protect companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by malicious bots. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive benefits and day-to-day culture in order for every human to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).                  The HUMAN R&D team is pivotal to our mission to protect the heart of the internet by disrupting the economics of cybercrime. They are the ones uncovering and fighting bot operations like PARETO, ICEBUCKET, 3ve, and Methbot. HUMAN supports our R&D humans by strongly valuing deep work and flexibility. Company-wide meeting-free Fridays give you uninterrupted time to work on your projects. Additionally, this team is encouraged to participate in R&D Research Friday - a designated half-day each week dedicated to trying new ideas and personal career development. HUMAN is fully committed to flexible working arrangements, or as we call it, work from anywhere, anytime. All of this is to ensure our humans are able to do the best work of their lives.                  We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN.                  DS@HUMANsec              The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception.                  The human we need for this role will work on      BotGuard : our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.                    What you will do:             Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product.  Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work.  Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate.  Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy.  Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers.  Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you.                          Who you are:             You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!).  You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers.  You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate.  Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well.  You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles.  You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.                          Benefits & Perks             Unlimited PTO  Private medical and dental insurance for all full-time employees  Fully paid parental leave  Learning & Development budget  Phenomenal coaching from senior leaders and challenging development opportunities  Monthly internet, phone bill, and meal stipend to support working remotely during COVID-19  Company-sponsored TalkSpace membership for you and your family                          Life at HUMAN:                   HUMAN  prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!                  With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, with teams in London, Virginia, and Victoria, we trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The benefits package we provide reflects our remote-first culture and our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development. We also offer weekly lunches, flexible time off, no-meeting Fridays, HUMAN days, sabbatical programs, and so much more.                  We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.
