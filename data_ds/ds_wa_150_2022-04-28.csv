The people  are whip-smart, deeply committed, and energizing.  The technology  is multi-patented, AI-powered, industry-shaping customer data management software that we invented because there was no way to solve the problems that we wanted to help consumer brands overcome.  The opportunity  is twofold: a market opportunity to provide a solution that consumer brands have been trying to find for decades, and a personal opportunity to grow and learn and hitch your career to a rocket ship.  Since our founding in 2016, Amperity has been growing 2.5X year-over-year. We've raised $187M in funding, including a recent Series D that increased our valuation to over one billion dollars. We're going places, fast, and we want you to come with us.  We help top brands make sense of massive amounts of transaction and engagement data so that they can finally know who their customers are, what opportunities exist, and how to provide the kinds of experiences that delight consumers and move the business metrics that matter. Our customers include Starbucks, Alaska Airlines, Patagonia, Kroger, J. Crew, Brooks Running, Planet Fitness, DICK's Sporting Goods, and many more.  We're building something that's never existed before, and we're doing it in a way that's great for consumers, transformational for our customers, and career-making for the members of the Amperity team. Come help us make it happen! The Team  The data science team at Amperity is a close-knit community of engineers and data scientists that move quickly and motivate each other to think independently, work autonomously, handle ambiguity, and solve hard problems. We identify, design and implement algorithms that lie at the heart of our products:   Identity matching: deduplicating and clustering billions of records to their underlying identities daily. Our customers use our predictions to analyze their customer base and create a personalized experience for their customers at every touchpoint.  Predictive modeling: With unified and enriched customer profiles (thanks to our identity matching pipeline), we build advanced customer-centric models to predict metrics/behaviors such as customer lifetime value, product recommendations, discount sensitivity, and event propensity.   In addition to algorithmic development, we value sharing our findings with the broader data science community. We publish our research in top-tier peer-reviewed publications, engage with fellow data scientists by speaking at internal and external conferences, and also hold several patents focused on our core IP (with many more to come).  We're looking for a Data Scientist to join our rapidly growing data science team to help develop predictive models and ML techniques that keep us at the forefront of predictive marketing analytics. Your work will be instrumental in developing new IP, improving the efficacy of existing models, and researching new methods as we continue to increase the surface area of our predictive modeling suite.  What You'll Do  Research and prototype models to extract insights from massive databases of customer interactions with brands across retail, hospitality, dining, and more  Be part of a team making deep investments in experimental design, statistical rigor, and model interpretability  Ensure our models can be reliably reproduced and integrated with a platform driving insights for dozens of leading brands  Develop IP in the form of patents, research papers, and conference presentations  Be part of an active (and fun) group of machine learning practitioners and data scientists distributed across New York and Seattle  About You  Undergraduate degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g. statistics, mathematics) with 2+ years of experience building out predictive models using advanced statistical or ML techniques in a production environment  You have the technical competence to perform advanced analytics: coding skills (such as Python, Java, or Scala), experience with analytics & visualization tools (Pandas, R, SPSS, SQL, Hadoop, Tableau), and experience performing analysis with large datasets  Prior research in an industry setting in one of the following areas: entity matching, probabilistic databases, or predictive marketing analytics  Significant expertise in a broad set of ML concepts ranging from regression to clustering, along with model prototyping, tuning, and evaluation  Ability to synthesize complex ideas for both technical and non-technical audiences. Good communication skills in conducting code reviews, writing technical documentation, and giving internal and external presentations.

We also offer self-managed PTO and the flexibility to do your best work in the way that works for you.

The people  are whip-smart, deeply committed, and energizing.  The technology  is multi-patented, AI-powered, industry-shaping customer data management software that we invented because there was no way to solve the problems that we wanted to help consumer brands overcome.  The opportunity  is twofold: a market opportunity to provide a solution that consumer brands have been trying to find for decades, and a personal opportunity to grow and learn and hitch your career to a rocket ship.  Since our founding in 2016, Amperity has been growing 2.5X year-over-year. We've raised $187M in funding, including a recent Series D that increased our valuation to over one billion dollars. We're going places, fast, and we want you to come with us.  We help these brands make sense of massive amounts of transaction and engagement data so that they can finally know who their customers are, what opportunities exist, and how to provide the kinds of experiences that delight consumers and move the business metrics that matter. Our customers include Starbucks, Alaska Airlines, Patagonia, Kroger, J. Crew, Brooks Running, Planet Fitness, DICK's Sporting Goods, and many more.  We're building something that's never existed before, and we're doing it in a way that's great for consumers, transformational for our customers, and career-making for the members of the Amperity team. Come help us make it happen! The Team  The data science team at Amperity is a close-knit community of engineers and data scientists that move quickly and motivate each other to think independently, work autonomously, handle ambiguity, and solve hard problems. We identify, design and implement algorithms that lie at the heart of our products:   Identity matching: deduplicating and clustering billions of records to their underlying identities daily. Our customers use our predictions to analyze their customer base and create a personalized experience for their customers at every touchpoint.  Predictive modeling: With unified and enriched customer profiles (thanks to our identity matching pipeline), we build advanced customer-centric models to predict metrics/behaviors such as customer lifetime value, product recommendations, discount sensitivity, and event propensity.   In addition to algorithmic development, we value sharing our findings with the broader data science community. We publish our research in top-tier peer-reviewed publications, engage with fellow data scientists by speaking at internal and external conferences, and also hold several patents focused on our core IP (with many more to come).  We're looking for a Lead Data Scientist to join our rapidly growing data science team. As a Lead, you'll have the opportunity to drive our efforts in developing state-of-the-art predictive models and ML techniques in identity resolution, marketing analytics, and user behavioral forecasting. Day to day, you'll focus on developing new IP, improving the efficacy of existing models, and researching new methods as we continue to increase the surface area of our predictive modeling suite.  What You'll Do  Self-driven research and prototyping to extract insights from massive databases of customer interactions with brands across retail, hospitality, dining, and more  Lead a team that's making deep investments in experimental design, statistical rigor, and model interpretability  Ensure our models can be reliably reproduced and integrated with a platform driving insights for dozens (and soon to be hundreds) of leading brands  Develop IP in the form of patents, research papers, and conference presentations  Be part of an active (and fun) group of machine learning practitioners and data scientists distributed across New York and Seattle  About You  Undergraduate degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g. statistics, mathematics) with 4+ years of experience building out predictive models using advanced statistical or ML techniques in a production environment  Advanced degree, authored papers in well-known journals, and registered patents all strongly preferred  You have production-level competence to perform advanced modeling: coding skills (such as Python, Java, or Scala), experience with analytics & visualization tools (Pandas, R, SPSS, SQL, Hadoop, Tableau), and experience with distributed computing (Spark, TensorFlow, PyTorch)  Prior research in an industry setting in one of the following areas: entity matching, probabilistic databases, or predictive marketing analytics  Significant expertise in a broad set of ML concepts ranging from random forests to generative probabilistic models, along with model prototyping, tuning, and evaluation  Ability to synthesize complex ideas for both technical and non-technical audiences. Good communication skills in conducting code reviews, writing technical documentation, and giving internal and external presentations.   Benefits  We offer all the benefits you'd expect from a great place to work: 100% employee healthcare coverage, transportation subsidies, a comfortable work environment with plenty of snacks, and other employee experience perks like events and activities, both in-person and remote. We also offer self-managed PTO and the flexibility to do your best work in the way that works for you.

If you want to learn more about our grand vision, read what has become our ""manifesto."" Our system, developed with open source roots, shifts the paradigm of data science workflows by providing reproducibility, data provenance, and opportunity for true collaboration. Pachyderm utilizes modern technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to build an entirely new method of analyzing data. Offered both as an in-house solution as well as hosted-service, Pachyderm brings together version-control for data with the tools to build scalable end-to-end ML/AI pipelines while empowering users to use any language, framework, or tool they want.    What it's like being part of The Pach  Pachyderm is a rapidly growing, Series B company funded by the top VC's — Benchmark, Decibel, M12, and YCombinator. Pachyderm has always and will always embrace a ""Remote-first"" approach to growing our team. This allows us to hire a diverse group of individuals across the country (and world!) while giving our team members the flexibility to work from anywhere.  Being a member of The Pach means joining a supportive team that cares about you, values kindness and works hard to create an open and transparent workplace.  Pachyderm is still small, so joining means you are getting in right at the ground floor and have an enormous impact on the success and direction of the company and product.  Primary Job Responsibilities  As a Customer Engineer at Pachyderm, you will be part of a small, elite, customer-facing engineering team (think Seal Team 6) devoted to solving challenging infrastructure and data platform issues for both our open source users and enterprise customers. This can be anything from debugging network issues to architecting complex machine learning pipelines to troubleshooting Kubernetes and Docker. This role is perfect for engineers who love working directly with customers and prefer to witness success alongside the user first-hand.  The Customer Engineer will also be responsible for providing ""white glove"" technical service to Pachyderm customers by supporting, adopting and providing guidance over the Pachyderm platform. This is mostly a post-sales role focused on maximizing value for our enterprise deployments, but will also include working on PoCs, engaging with prominent OSS users, and being part of our broader customer success org. You will manage our customers through deployment, training, implementation of best practices, and ongoing troubleshooting. These projects can range from small projects at AI technology startups to fortune 100 enterprise implementations.  While you'll have direct access and support from our engineering team, you will also have ample opportunity to commit the core Pachyderm codebase yourself. As an open source project, detailed GitHub issues are great, but PRs are pure gold! You'll also have direct exposure to our community of users via our open source support channels. At Pachyderm, OSS user and customer feedback is a major driver of our product roadmap and we believe that everyone within the company should experience that first-hand.   Additional Responsibilities   Advise on technical support and product adoption for customers in line with pre-sales, post-sales and the renewal processes  Analyze customer's Data Science Infrastructure on a regular basis and provide recommendations that will maximize Pachyderm's value  Be the customer's advocate by knowing their goals and use cases then suggesting process changes, product adoption, configuration and additional features to meet their requirements  Mentor and train the customer's champions  Participate and prepare for Monthly and Quarterly Business Reviews with customers  Collaborate with Pachyderm's product management, engineering and technical services teams to help identify new features and products  Continuously evolve best practice to technical product adoption and customer success   Qualifications   Possess a solid technical grounding with hands-on experience in a containerized infrastructure  You have a never-ending passion for learning  You are a self-starter, tech-savvy professional and it's easy for you to understand a company's business requirements and explain Pachyderm's value and technical details to C-level executives, a technical guru and everything in between  Previous hands on experience with AWS, Azure or GCP  Development experience in Golang, Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, etc…  CI/CD tools e.g. Jenkins, Gitlab etc..  Containerization tools e.g. Docker, Kubernetes or Rancher etc..  CLI experience, Linux, basic programming skills, debugging, installing tools   Bonus Points   Previous experience in Professional Services supporting Enterprise customers in the Data Science/ML infrastructure space  You have experience using Pachyderm and/or other ML/Data Science platforms  Development experience in Golang, Python, C/C++ or similar is great too  Benefits:   Significant equity, 401k and full benefits (100% medical, dental and vision for employees, 50% for all dependents).
