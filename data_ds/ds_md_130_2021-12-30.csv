A complete application consists of:  An application  Transcripts –  A current resume/CV, including academic history, employment history, relevant experiences, and publication list  One educational or professional recommendation   All documents must be in English or include an official English translation.  If you have questions, send an email to ORISE.FDA.CDER@orau.org. Please include the reference code for this opportunity in your email.  Application Deadline  1/31/2022 3:00:00 PM Eastern Time Zone Description  Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.  A research opportunity is available in the Office of Generic Drugs/ Office of Research and Standards (ORS), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) located in Silver Spring, Maryland. CDER performs an essential public health task by making sure that safe and effective drugs are available to improve the health of people in the United States. As part of the FDA, CDER regulates over-the-counter and prescription drugs, including biological therapeutics and generic drugs. This work covers more than just medicines.  Survival analysis is performed to analyze the expected time-to-event occurrence, such as forecasting the time to submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). The Cox model has been commonly used for survival analysis; however, due to its oversimplified assumptions (e.g., linearity and proportional hazard), the Cox model is at risk of underperforming when modeling complex data (e.g., nonlinear and/or high dimension). Among other developments made to address shortcomings of the Cox model, DeepHit, a deep learning-based survival analysis is the sought-after one. We aim to conduct a systematic performance check for the DeepHit, compared to other survival models.  Under the guidance of the mentor, the participant will learn to define/identify a valid question, which should be scientifically meaningful; to design a study to check the performance of computational methods; to identify/collect correct datasets, including synthesizing data by simulations; to conduct data analysis including model construction; to evaluate performance of model and interpret results. The participant will also gain research knowledge in the regulatory environment.  This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and FDA. The initial appointment is for ten months, but may be renewed upon recommendation of FDA contingent on the availability of funds. The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. The appointment can be full-time or part-time at FDA in the Silver Spring, Maryland, area. Participants do not become employees of FDA, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.  Completion of a successful background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management is required for an applicant to be on-boarded at FDA. OPM can complete a background investigation only for individuals, including non-US Citizens, who have resided in the US for a total of three of the past five years.  FDA requires ORISE participants to read and sign their FDA Education and Training Agreement within 30 days of his/her start date, setting forth the conditions and expectations for his/her educational appointment at the agency. This agreement covers such topics as the following:  Non-employee nature of the ORISE appointment;  Prohibition on ORISE Fellows performing inherently governmental functions;  Obligation of ORISE Fellows to convey all necessary rights to the FDA regarding intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice during their fellowship;  The fact that research materials and laboratory notebooks are the property of the FDA;  ORISE fellow’s obligation to protect and not to further disclose or use non-public information  Qualifications  The qualified candidate should be currently pursuing or have received a bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree in one of the relevant fields.

Of particular interests are the security of Internet of Things (IoT), sensors networks, wearable devices, mobile phones, robots, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. These IoT devices are most often designed without considering security. Unprotected IoT devices can be used as “stepping stones” by attackers to launch more sophisticated attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). A later stage of APT is the “lateral movement” stage, where attackers use benign computer features to move step-by-step deeper into the network in a stealthy manner.  Emphasis is placed on research related to new techniques for the prediction, prevention, detection, resilience, survival and recovery from IoT attack. This effort pursues mathematical excellence in the following relevant areas which impact IoT cybersecurity: APT; cyber deception; IoT defense-in-depth; and end-to-end determination of security assurance. Theoretical constructs or mathematical abstractions provide a rigorous scientific basis for cyber security because they allow for reasoning quantitatively about cyber-attacks. This opportunity involves the use of several mathematical approaches, including game theory to capture the strategic behavior of malicious adversaries and automatically formulate the optimum policies; graph theory to build and formalize attack-graphs; and adversarial machine learning for adaptation to dynamic change in operating scenario. Limited rationality, incomplete information, imperfect monitoring in distributed networks are among the challenges to be considered.
