We have grown from a groundbreaking research project at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence to a product millions of scholars use every week. Semantic Scholar uses artificial intelligence to extract the semantics, or meaning, of scientific literature and surface it to our users through a discovery experience that helps them understand science more effectively than any other tool.  Since our launch in 2015, we have indexed more than 180 million research papers and built a user base of millions of scholars in over 100 countries. Our work has been featured in the New York Times, Wired, Nature, Science, and many other publications. In March 2020, Semantic Scholar released the  CORD-19  dataset, a free resource of over 130,000 scholarly articles about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses for use by the global research community. The dataset is now updated daily and supports dozens of research initiatives around the world.  The Data Team software development manager owns the team and systems that fetch hundreds of millions of research paper data from myriad sources and create high quality, information- rich structured representations of research papers. These representations power the Semantic Scholar research knowledge graph, rich website experience, and a host of AI features. The quality and timeliness of this data is crucial to enabling Semantic Scholar's users to easily find and understand the latest research, which has a large multiplier effect in their ability to generate their own cutting-edge research.

You also use those skills to be a connector - you have a knack for connecting people and building bridges across different teams and locations.  You have experience working with a top tier customer-facing product management team, and understand how to ingest customer-informed guidance and prioritization, and enabling your teams to translate that to a 'how', with clear prioritization.  You are strong technically and can converse in technical detail with talented engineers. Ideally you have hands-on experience shipping customer-facing apps with heavy ML and data components. However we will consider applicants without direct experience in ML but who are very strong technically, if you are outstanding in other areas.  You build process where it's needed. You know how to cut through bureaucracy when it's inefficient, but also how to create structure when it's needed.  You're able to distill complex and ambiguous situations into actionable plans for your team, and are highly organized..  Bonus: You have experience with contact center industry.   What?   DON'T SETTLE: Provide support and guidance that enables the team to self-organize and to predictably deliver customer value. Foster a culture that encourages individual decision-making and innovation. Inclusive communication will also be critical to maintaining alignment and our culture across our global locations.  WEAR THE CUSTOMER'S SHOES: Collaborate on engineering deliverables with product and engineering leaders across San Francisco, Colombia, Prague, Denver, Madrid, and London, ensuring that engineering decisions are always aligned with customer needs.  EMPOWER OTHERS: Inspire your teams and manage their career development by providing coaching and mentoring to junior members while guiding senior contributors to maximize their potential. Provide continuous performance feedback, collaborate with employees on their objectives and provide a clear path for progression through personal development plans. Act as an ambassador for Twilio, recruiting and motivating top talent.  BE INCLUSIVE: Be hands-on with the team - both product and engineering. You are not expected to deliver code, but you should possess enough technical experience in cloud-based infrastructure design and operations to be able to analyze the important decisions your team faces.  WRITE IT DOWN: Institute engineering best practices - ensure the team produces high quality architectural blueprints, consistent coding standards, and operates and maintains systems that exceed our SLAs to customers.  BE AN OWNER: Foster leadership principles and behaviors throughout the organization to build up the next generation of leaders.  Travel required - up to 10% of the time post-COVID   Why?  Today, Twilio powers the delivery of billions of the world's communications. Customer conversations are one of the most informative indicators of a product and business' health. They cover every time a customer was delighted, frustrated, buying more, closing their account, needing help, etc. But usually those conversations are trapped away in a black box, analyzed only by listening to them one by one, or with basic keyword search capabilities.  The Twilio AI team is building a platform that uses machine learning to transcribe, categorize, and extract meaning out of customer conversations so companies can evaluate every one of them and build workflows that automate actions, like prioritizing high value leads to follow up on or identifying customers likely to churn. Our goal is to help companies power more effective business processes and better customer engagement, by understanding the meaning in every conversation.  Where?  We are a team that believes in remote working and remote-friendly practices, and we are distributed across three continents. This position can be located in either the US or EU, either remote or (post-COVID) in one of Twilio's offices . What you will also get to experience is a company that believes in small teams for maximum impact; that strives to balance work and home life, that understands that this is a marathon, not a sprint; that continuously and purposefully builds an inclusive culture where everyone is able to do and be the best version of themselves. We seek people who naturally demonstrate our values, who are challenged by problems, empower others to thrive, people who can draw the owl and not be beholden to one playbook.  What We Offer  There are many benefits to working at Twilio, including, in addition to competitive pay, things like generous time-off, ample parental and wellness leave, healthcare, a retirement savings program, and much more. Offerings vary by location.  Twilio thinks big. Do you?  We like to solve problems, take initiative, pitch in when needed, and are always up for trying new things. That's why we seek out colleagues who embody our values — something we call Twilio Magic. Additionally, we empower employees to build positive change in their communities by supporting their volunteering and donation efforts.  So, if you're ready to unleash your full potential, do your best work, and be the best version of yourself, apply now!
