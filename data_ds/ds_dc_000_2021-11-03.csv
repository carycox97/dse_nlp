Of particular interests are the security of Internet of Things (IoT), sensors networks, wearable devices, mobile phones, robots, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. These IoT devices are most often designed without considering security. Unprotected IoT devices can be used as “stepping stones” by attackers to launch more sophisticated attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). A later stage of APT is the “lateral movement” stage, where attackers use benign computer features to move step-by-step deeper into the network in a stealthy manner.  Emphasis is placed on research related to new techniques for the prediction, prevention, detection, resilience, survival and recovery from IoT attack. This effort pursues mathematical excellence in the following relevant areas which impact IoT cybersecurity: APT; cyber deception; IoT defense-in-depth; and end-to-end determination of security assurance. Theoretical constructs or mathematical abstractions provide a rigorous scientific basis for cyber security because they allow for reasoning quantitatively about cyber-attacks. This opportunity involves the use of several mathematical approaches, including game theory to capture the strategic behavior of malicious adversaries and automatically formulate the optimum policies; graph theory to build and formalize attack-graphs; and adversarial machine learning for adaptation to dynamic change in operating scenario. Limited rationality, incomplete information, imperfect monitoring in distributed networks are among the challenges to be considered.

This change has shifted the bottleneck for development to the availability of annotated image libraries. To train a convoluted neural network, thousands of carefully annotated images are required. These images must also be manipulated using synthetic image pipelines that amplify the original image dataset into the hundreds of thousands of images that are ultimately used for training.  Learning Objectives :  The selected participant will gain experience in data engineering needed to amplify the development and access to computer vision and AI for ARS scientists. The participant will: collaborate with a national team of weed scientists to create a repository of imagery covering the major agricultural weed species in the U.S., document the latest techniques for repository management and synthetic image creation, and contribute to the level of knowledge about these methods across ARS to other disciplines.  Mentor(s) :  The mentor for this opportunity is Steven Mirsky (steven.mirsky@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact the mentor(s).  Anticipated Appointment Start Date :  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.  Appointment Length :  The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.  Level of Participation :  The appointment is full-time.  Participant Stipend :  The participant(s) will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.  Citizenship Requirements :  This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.  ORISE Information :  This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=556460773a1b14c9&from=web&vjs=3,370,Mathematician,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD","NSA OverviewThe professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission.Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information).Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country.Description of PositionNSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals.Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability.The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in:- Signals analysis- Data compression- Machine learning- Data science- Human language technology- Speech/image/video processing- Analysis of communication networks- Network vulnerability analysis- CybersecurityAdditionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively. Job Summary NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals to collaborate in both long and short term work to solve mission-critical problems. To solve the problems generated by NSA's mission, mathematicians draw from a wide body of mathematical knowledge, including number theory, abstract algebra, graph theory, combinatorics, analysis, probability, statistics and more. However, the essential ingredient to the solution of a problem is often not mathematical knowledge per se, but the keen analytic ability that a mathematician possesses through training and talent.

The Associated Press is seeking a data scientist with a deep understanding of American elections and experience working with complex statistical models to join its public opinion research and election decision team. In this role, you will be a senior member of AP’s decision team and responsible for the development and maintenance of the statistical models and tools the AP uses to declare winners of U.S. elections. The successful candidate will also collaborate extensively with AP’s data journalism team and will be based in Washington, D.C.   About us  Since 1848, Americans and people around the globe have relied on The Associated Press to tell them who has won and lost American elections. As the world looks to the AP, the AP looks to the dedicated team of election experts, survey research professionals and data journalists who make up our election decision team.   Our mission is not to make predictions or projections, but to tell Americans who the winners are as soon as the outcome is certain - and not a moment before. For our core decision team, our work before, during and after elections includes:   Research focused on understanding election history and election rules at the state, local and national level.

You have a strong theoretical understanding of the design and interpretation of complex statistical models, including how to incorporate uncertainty into those models. You also have a holistic understanding of the sources of that uncertainty.   You’re a skilled R programmer, comfortable with manipulating complex statistical model specifications, translating those specifications into code and optimizing that code for efficient and reliable processing on election night. Experience with Python is also a plus, as is experience working in survey methods.   You’re a skilled researcher who’s comfortable digging into large datasets, including state voter files and past election results, and are eager to understand how historical patterns can help us understand elections. But you’re also willing to test our assumptions about how those patterns hold. You are eager to share ideas and learn from colleagues with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise.   You’ll help train people from across the company to understand how to use the models we’ve built as a team, and should be comfortable explaining high level statistical concepts to people without formal training in statistics.
