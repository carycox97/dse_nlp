The field is currently limited by reliance on subjective and non-specific symptoms and in need of evolution to a more objective means by which to determine the presence of injury and the trajectory of recovery. CHOP is pioneering objective measures of injury and dysfunction. The successful candidate will work with a multi-disciplinary team of injury scientists including sports and emergency medicine physicians, neurologists, epidemiologists, bioengineers, and nurses at CHOP’s Center for Injury Research and Prevention (CIRP). As an integral member of this interdisciplinary research team, the postdoc will have opportunities to lead advanced data analysis using existing data collected prospectively from ongoing funded studies. This data collection is embedded within clinical settings including CHOP Sports Medicine clinic and Emergency Department (for injured youth) and through partnerships with schools and athletic departments (for healthy athletes). These opportunities include but are not limited to (1) analysis of diverse measures of neurophysiology post injury to determine which measures or suite of measures are most diagnostically sensitive to concussion and prognostic of adverse long term outcomes in adolescents, (2) development of a personalized medicine approach to concussion management through advanced machine learning and related analytical techniques, and (3) quantification of the effect of a season of sport on measures of neurofunction.            The postdoc experience will serve to extend, refine, and enhance skills necessary for professional and career development and will enable the individual to broaden his/her scientific background by acquiring new research capabilities. It is expected that this individual will conduct independent scholarly research and will contribute directly to the overall research goals of the Minds Matter research group. During the course of the position, the postdoc will be expected to contribute to composition and submission of grants, to supervise junior team members, and to publish his/her research. Opportunities for submission of a career development award will be emphasized. The postdoc will be expected to participate in project planning, interpretation/ evaluation of data, and communication of results. They will be trained in a comprehensive and unique outreach approach by the CIRP Outreach and Advocacy team embedded within CIRP. The postdoc will also be expected to acquire technical, advanced data analysis, and manuscript/grant writing skills and participate in seminars, lectures, poster sessions, and presentations at national meetings.

The research involves applying multi-modal brain implantable systems in non-human primates (NHPs, rhesus monkeys) to uncover the co-active molecular dopamine and electrical neural signaling underlying key decision making, mood regulation, motor control behaviors, and how these evolve over the course of learning in health and in disease (e.g. Parkinson’s disease). The Schwerdt lab previously established cutting-edge methods to look at brain activity in a new way, that is, by recording both chemical (i.e. dopamine) and electrical (spike and local field potential) neural activity using electrochemistry (FSCV) and electrophysiology, respectively, and to be able to do this over chronic year-long time scales. This position involves leading experimental design to collect and analyze large-scale neural signals (dopamine, spikes, and oscillations) made from striatum and interconnected basal ganglia regions of task performing rhesus monkeys.  This position offers opportunities for growth and expansion of skills in advanced primate neurophysiology and brain activity mapping (e.g. electrochemistry, electrophysiology, microstimulation, neurosurgery, task design), microfabrication, and systems neuroscience. The individual is expected to work as a team with the principal investigator and other undergraduate and graduate students, and laboratory technicians. The individual is expected to prepare and write high quality journal papers for peer-review and scientific dissemination, present significant research progress in scientific workshops and/or conferences, and participate in grant writing.  Candidates should hold a Ph.D. in neuroscience, engineering (electrical, bio-, biomedical, chemical, or mechanical), biology, psychology, computer science or another computational major, mathematics, physics, or other related fields (e.g. chemistry, neurobiology, etc.) and have excellent communication and interpersonal skills, organizational skills, strong work ethics and motivational drive, the ability to design and carry out research independently, and evidence of sufficient research experiences (e.g. publication record). Highly competitive applicants will have experience in one or more of the following: non-human primate electrophysiology; neuroscience; behavioral training and task design; computational analysis, modeling, and programming in Matlab; data science, statistics, machine learning or other advanced mathematical computational and analytic techniques to analyze neural data; animal handling and surgeries; and/or grant writing.

In R&D At GSK, we want to find new medicines and vaccines in ways that are faster, more effective and more predictable. We start with what matters most, the science. Our approach to R&D focuses on science related to the immune system, the use of human genetics, and advanced technologies. Our pipeline currently comprises of more than 60 vaccines and medicines across four core therapeutic areas including oncology, infectious diseases, immunology / respiratory and HIV. We have pivotal study starts in 2021 for our RSV vaccine in older adults, COVID-19 assets, long-acting anti-IL-5 antagonist, daprodustat, and dostarlimab. In oncology, momentum is building with 15 potential medicines in trials, including nine immuno-oncology and three cell therapies. We give our scientists the freedom to own the process. Our scientists often use genetic data to help us understand the root cause of disease. We steer the research where the data shows we can do most good. If a project doesn’t pan out, we take what we’ve learned and apply it elsewhere. Technology can help us find patterns in genetic data better and faster. We’re using machine learning to unlock the potential of complex genetic data with new levels of speed, precision, and scale. And we’re one of the first biopharmaceutical companies to have created an in-house AI lab dedicated to drug development. Even with the knowledge, tools, and resources within GSK, there’s always a benefit to new perspectives. That's why we're increasingly partnering with and hiring outstanding people from cutting edge fields like tech, data-science and academia. In 2018, GSK formed an exclusive, highly innovative collaboration with 23andMe, the world's leading consumer genetics and research company. Other partners include: the Altius Institute; the UK Biobank, which is generating anonymized genetic sequence data from 500,000 volunteers; and the Open Targets Consortium, the mindset and approach of smaller, more agile startups. Find out more: Our approach to R&D. Why GSK? At GSK, we have delivered unprecedented change over the past four years - to improve R&D productivity and performance, transform commercial execution and to, strengthen our leadership and reshape our organisation. Now, we’re getting ready to deliver the most significant change to our company in over 20 years.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=81f117740cfbb97c&from=web&vjs=3,300,"Analyst, Data Science & linguistics, CX",Evoke NA,"Philadelphia, PA","     Customer Experience (CX) Data Analyst      Evoke is a marketing and advertising agency servicing the healthcare industry. We partner with leading pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, consistently delivering unparalleled levels of strategic, creative, and technological innovation that build richer and more effective interactions between our clients and their customers.      The Importance of CX & Data Analytics      CX is a customers' holistic perception of their experience of a brand. This perception is made up by every interaction a customer has with the brand, from navigating the website, to making a purchase, to engaging with customer service, and even to the delivery of the product itself.      At Evoke, we believe that in order to fundamentally make health more human, we have to understand the CX. We have to understand the journeys of each core customer, looking for moments of friction, moments of frustration or moments where expectations are not met. By revealing these experiences, we are able to understand where to step in and create solutions that are truly meaningful, are often unique to a category, and ultimately create a seamless CX.      Evoke is proud to have embraced the power of Big Data as a crucial mechanism to help us understand consumer attitudes, behaviors, and expectations. The macro data enables us to substantiate findings in the CX as well as generate new ways to understand human behavior.      To help us accomplish this we are looking to add a full-time CX Data Analyst to the team here at Evoke. The ideal hire should have strong skills across all aspects of data analytics and research, including mining, cleaning, clustering, analysis, and visualization. The candidate should also showcase ease of conveying complex data into readable, goal-oriented outputs.      Job Description      At Evoke, the CX Data Analyst anchors the research to a scientific methodology, but continuously creates new ways to analyze the data. The role is not a copy-paste-print-present type of position, where the same report needs to be refreshed every quarter. Instead, the Evoke CX Data Analyst is challenged with Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Key Business Questions (KBQs), Audience Behavior, and much more. It's this versatile breath of analysis that requires someone who's willing to continuously explore, experiment, and learn, yet deliver a project on time while taking ownership.      The CX Data Analyst would predominantly be working with text-based data, analyzing hundreds of thousands of data points to arrive at linguistic findings. These insights will often align against KBQs provided by CX Strategy and other team-members. Therefore, the CX Data Analyst needs to have a strong collaborative nature and enjoy teaming up on projects so that it may reach its full potential. The CX Data Analyst should always want to go ""one level deeper"" asking ""Why did the consumer do that?"" or ""Why does the consumer thing this?""      The CX Data Analyst will join a small team that has experienced strong growth providing research and solutions across a broad range of therapeutic areas and disease states.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=64aac6657f6927ac&from=web&vjs=3,300,"ANALYST, DATA SCIENCE & LINGUISTICS, CX",Evoke Health,"Philadelphia, PA","           Customer Experience (CX) Data Analyst       Evoke is a marketing and advertising agency servicing the healthcare industry. We partner with leading pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients, consistently delivering unparalleled levels of strategic, creative, and technological innovation that build richer and more effective interactions between our clients and their customers.       The Importance of CX & Data Analytics       CX is a customers’ holistic perception of their experience of a brand. This perception is made up by every interaction a customer has with the brand, from navigating the website, to making a purchase, to engaging with customer service, and even to the delivery of the product itself.       At Evoke, we believe that in order to fundamentally make health more human, we have to understand the CX. We have to understand the journeys of each core customer, looking for moments of friction, moments of frustration or moments where expectations are not met. By revealing these experiences, we are able to understand where to step in and create solutions that are truly meaningful, are often unique to a category, and ultimately create a seamless CX.       Evoke is proud to have embraced the power of Big Data as a crucial mechanism to help us understand consumer attitudes, behaviors, and expectations. The macro data enables us to substantiate findings in the CX as well as generate new ways to understand human behavior.       To help us accomplish this we are looking to add a full-time CX Data Analyst to the team here at Evoke. The ideal hire should have strong skills across all aspects of data analytics and research, including mining, cleaning, clustering, analysis, and visualization. The candidate should also showcase ease of conveying complex data into readable, goal-oriented outputs.       Job Description       At Evoke, the CX Data Analyst anchors the research to a scientific methodology, but continuously creates new ways to analyze the data. The role is not a copy-paste-print-present type of position, where the same report needs to be refreshed every quarter. Instead, the Evoke CX Data Analyst is challenged with Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Key Business Questions (KBQs), Audience Behavior, and much more. It’s this versatile breath of analysis that requires someone who’s willing to continuously explore, experiment, and learn, yet deliver a project on time while taking ownership.       The CX Data Analyst would predominantly be working with text-based data, analyzing hundreds of thousands of data points to arrive at linguistic findings. These insights will often align against KBQs provided by CX Strategy and other team-members. Therefore, the CX Data Analyst needs to have a strong collaborative nature and enjoy teaming up on projects so that it may reach its full potential. The CX Data Analyst should always want to go “one level deeper” asking “Why did the consumer do that?” or “Why does the consumer thing this?”       The CX Data Analyst will join a small team that has experienced strong growth providing research and solutions across a broad range of therapeutic areas and disease states.       Specific duties include:            Work directly with other team-members (most often CX Strategy) to conduct Linguistic Analysis and NLP Research across Journey Mapping, Voice of Customer Analysis, Competitive Gap Analysis, Search Behavior Summary Social Media Listening, New Business Pitch Support etc.       Execute data mining, identifying optimal data sources, extracting data, connect to APIs or building data scrapers       Execute data cleaning, understanding best practices, and leverage Python to pre-processes for analysis       Execute data clustering across different data sources to combine a more robust dataset       Execute data clustering against specific rules to establish relevant subsets of data       Execute data analysis using several research techniques with a focus on NLP (examples below):              Top volume across clustered search terms         Top volume across topics/terms/n-grams/sentiment/emojis used on social         Top sources of influence across channels, forums, blogs, news, SERP, accounts, products etc.         Longitudinal content relevance         Audience language analysis             Execute data visualization across Excel and Python leveraging packages such as Seaborn, matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh or others       Craft a story from the data, conveying complex insights in simple visuals and communicate the takeaways with ease       Help develop new research offerings and outside the box solutions for both internal and external purposes       Continuously consider automation and optimization across current research streams and projects       Keep current on best practices for data analytics; emerging trends, channels, technologies, platforms, and partners; and innovative programs and approaches           Skills / Qualifications:            2+ years in data analytics, specifically working with text-based data (search, social, reviews, news, transcripts, white papers, articles, excerpts etc.)       1+ years of agency experience preferred, but not required       Healthcare/pharmaceutical marketing preferred, but not required       Python proficiency required       Experience mining, cleansing, clustering, analyzing and visualizing data       Hands-on experience with web analytics platforms, social media listening tools, and search tools such as NetBase, Quid, Crimson Hexagon, Google Keyword Planner, SEMRush, GA etc.       Excellent written communication, verbal communication, and presentation skills       Proficiency in Microsoft Office, Excel, Word, PPT etc.       Willingness to learn new tools, code and software       Must be willing to travel up to 10%       BA/BS Degree (preferably in Computer Science, Economics, Statistics or Business Administration)       Demonstrate skills in adaptability, attention to detail, problem-solving, decision making, customer service, interpersonal relations, problem solving, project management, quality management, teamwork, presentations, results oriented, strategic thinker and team building           Additional Skills/Qualifications (Not Required but Highly Valuable):            Data analysis and research experience with:              Call Center Data         SEO/SEM         Scattertext         Topic Modeling (LDA)         CX Journey Mapping         Statistical & Predictive Modeling         GPT-3 or Neural Networks (RNN)         AI/ML image & video recognition         AI/ML classification best practices         SQL         Tableau                ",30+ days ago,2 reviews

You know (and can explain) networking, and how to tell when it’s not working as expected.      You understand and like working on the challenges of expanding beyond one machine, and how things change when you move from hundreds to thousands to millions of things/transactions/hits.      You know what “big data” means and (just as importantly) doesn’t mean.      You know what Artifactory and Docker bring to the development process.      You know why your code needs testing, and how to do that repeatably.      You know why automated builds and deployments matter and know what that’s called.      You know why “it runs fine on my laptop” generates eyerolls.      You’ve built scalable products that would be characterized as one or more of: distributed services, e-commerce, and fault tolerance.      You understand SQL beyond “SELECT * FROM TABLE”.      You can estimate levels of effort consistently, particularly in the context of comparing technical paths.      You have the grit and patience necessary to help clients through fear and uncertainty to champion adoption of modern stacks.      You sleep well because you design your code to be easily supportable, and you do this by listening to what your support team needs, so they don’t have your picture on a dartboard.      You understand that teams are built on trust and commitment as least as much as they are on slick code.      You have experience with technical debt.      You’ve worked in the Agile model (ideally Scrum).      You like understanding the goal and figuring out the best way to get there on your own, and articulating and selling your team on your solution, instead of having each step handed to you.        About the Role:         In this role you’ll be joining a team developing the next generation of the Informed Delivery project for the US Postal Service, an application used daily by over 17 million Americans and growing.      This role is located in our [Manassas Airport, Virginia] office, and is full-time.      This is a mid to senior level role. Most people in this role have 8-10 years of experience.      You do need to be able to obtain a Public Trust clearance for this position. This requires five years of continuous residency in the United States, a background investigation, and a drug test.        Tech Stack:         Java 8/11; Spring; Tomcat (or Websphere); React; Oracle/Postgres; Linux (mostly SuSE); Eclipse.        Tools:         Subversion (moving to git); Docker; Artifactory; Jenkins; JUnit; Selenium; JMeter; VersionOne; ALM; ServiceNow.        About Us:         OPTiMO provides digital transformation, design, software development and integration, and data analysis services, primarily to federal agencies.      Our offices are located in Manassas (Airport) VA, Wilkes Barre PA and Bloomsburg PA. We believe that face-to-face collaboration matters, and also that open plan offices are the worst idea ever.      We go beyond “project” thinking and strive to develop deep and thorough understanding of our clients’ operations, so we can be genuine partners. We think this is why we outperform organizations that just ‘hire for the project’ and jettison at the end of each.        You want:         The growth and learning opportunities of a contract role without the constant grind of worrying about finding the next project.      A flat organization where you can be heard.      A small team where everyone’s contribution matters.      The opportunity to stretch beyond things you’ve done before.      The opportunity to do more than be a cog – to be a valued member of a team.        We offer:         Escape from the Tysons commute.
