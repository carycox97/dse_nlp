Additionally, the successful candidate will have a familiarity and comfort being an independent contributor: evaluating, analyzing and modeling hazard and economic risks for our portfolios. Data scientists on this team specialize in an industry, but actively share best practices.  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES   Drive a portfolio of data science projects for the Commercial Finance Vertical using your knowledge of the traditional techniques, models, and methodologies; while also develop game-changing next-generation solutions that will disrupt the ""old way"" of doing things, from time-to-time.  Build/supervise a team of data scientists that support the respective portfolio companies under your purview. This team will handle the tactical execution of projects, while you provide thought leadership, strategy, supervision/guidance, mentorship, and even hands-on support to the team to ensure success.

You are the ultimate owner of the data science outcomes for the vertical.
