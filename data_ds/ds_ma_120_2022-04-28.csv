This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]      About Quora:      The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.      About the Team:      The Data Team is highly empowered at Quora, helping navigate complexity and influencing product and company strategy directly. Quora's outsized commitment to data is visible in everything we do, from our rigor-driven experimentation processes to the backgrounds of our leaders (including many Product Managers and the Head of Product being former full-time data scientists). With this emphasis on data and empirics, we aim to balance rigor and pragmatism, searching for scrappy solutions in pursuit of our mission. In joining Quora's strong data team, you'll both benefit from and work to advance our culture of rational decision making.      About the Role:      As a data scientist, you'll work closely with product managers, product designers, and engineers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, build visualizations, and tackle hard, open-ended problems that uncover usage patterns and opportunities for the company. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity.

Empowering more than 53 percent of the Fortune 500 in 198 countries, Payscale provides a combination of data-driven insights, best-in-class services and innovative software to enable organizations such as Angel City Football Club, Perry Ellis International, United Healthcare, Vista and The Washington Post to make fair and appropriate pay decisions. Pay is powerful. To learn more, visit www.payscale.com           Job Description    What We Do: The Data Science Team focuses on building models that leverage Payscale’s five core compensation datasets to provide accurate, high coverage estimates of compensation ranges for jobs across industries and the globe. We use modeling techniques such as Bayesian linear regression, hierarchical modeling, transfer learning, NLP, and embeddings to model how different jobs are related to each other in order to produce good compensation range predictions. We do a mix of development on well-defined projects and greenfield innovation on our own ideas. We build internal tools (APIs and interactive demos (using e.g. streamlit)) to exhibit our work. We value teamwork, learning together, maintainability, documentation, and giving clear presentations about our work to non-ML stakeholders. We are generalist problem solvers—we use (or learn!) the best tool for the problem. Our team is remote with some team members working out of offices in Seattle, WA and Burlington, MA periodically.     Our team works closely with compensation domain experts to help define the problems, identify and validate our assumptions, and evaluate our predictions. We are supported by a separate Data Engineering Team that helps turn our models into production APIs for use in products across Payscale’s portfolio.     What You Do: You will be designing and building machine learning models that provide compensation estimates in low-data scenarios, allow us to quantitatively compare jobs to each other (embeddings, NLP), and quantify the impact that skills and other compensable factors have on pay across jobs, industries, and locations. You’ll interface with domain experts and software engineers on a regular basis. You’ll give periodic presentations about your models/findings to a technical, but not-ML-trained audience. Our codebase is in Python, with some Pytorch and Tensorflow.     Day-in-the-Life:     As a Data Scientist II, a typical day may include the following:         Designing and building a new model      Meeting with domain experts to get feedback on models      Documenting findings, identifying promising avenues for model improvement      Partnering with Data Engineering Team to drive productionization of models      Participating in Data Science Book Club (bi-weekly open-invite learning workshop, currently focused on state-of-the-art NLP techniques)      Mentoring Data Analysts on analysis and visualization techniques (e.g. stats, regression)      Participating in team code reviews        First Year in Role:     By your third month, you’ll know how to access our datasets and code. You’ll be able to run the models that we are currently developing, and you’ll be contributing code to support these models—e.g. a new component for the evaluation suite, an internal head-to-head comparison of model results, or the application of one of our models to a particular domain.     By your sixth month, you have completely ramped up on the team and you’ll own your own workstream: meeting with stakeholders, designing and scoping solutions, building, and presenting your findings and progress.
