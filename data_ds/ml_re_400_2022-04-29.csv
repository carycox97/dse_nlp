Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. Because of that we’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and talent.

If you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology with a team that makes a difference every day, let’s talk.             About the Role          CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.             The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.             This is a senior Software Development Engineer (SDE) role in the engineering team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on Linux.

Who we are    We are a stealth-stage startup building an AI platform to drastically cut down the time that clinicians have to spend on EMR documentation and admin so that they can focus on what they do best: caring for patients. We are led by seasoned founders with direct experience building machine learning products in healthcare and deep connections to customers and strategic channel partners. After several watershed R&D breakthroughs, the team attracted significant funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Jeff Dean, Richard Socher, Pieter Abbeel, Anne Wojcicki, and healthcare industry veterans.   Role overview    Your mission is to guide the development of an artificial intelligence algorithm that is able to create SOAP notes for clinicians within seconds after patient encounters that are easy to review and easy to edit.   You’ll be responsible for guiding and educating a team of tens (eventually hundreds) of other medical professionals by:      Defining and prioritizing the space of unique medical concepts that our machine will need to learn how to include in auto-generated SOAP notes    Ensuring that our growing team understands how to accurately capture the diversity of ways in which these concepts are discussed in natural conversation    Monitoring the quality of the data going into our machine learning models and the performance of our machine learning models over time     Key Responsibilities:       Serve as a clinical key voice for the development of our AI technology, leveraging your professional experience to manage our team’s allocation of labeling resources.    Create educational systems and content that illustrate how medical interviews are translated into SOAP notes for our team of medical professionals. Develop the feedback loops required to continually refine these systems and content and ensure that they can scale to the education of hundreds of people.    Mentor and coach our team of medical professionals to ensure they can navigate the key nuances of medical conversations to create consistently high quality data assets    Liaise with the product, design, engineering, machine learning teams to translate clinical insight into product and algorithmic improvements that delight our clinician users.     Skills, Knowledge, and Expertise:       Experienced MD, PA, or NP with 3+ years of documentation experience (scribing or practicing) in urgent care, primary care, family medicine, or internal medicine (required)    Experience with tutoring, mentoring, and/or teaching others — in either formal or informal arrangements (preferred)    Experience with algorithmic thinking — writing computer programs, configuring software systems, setting up templates in your electronic medical record, etc. (nice-to-have)    Experience executing chart reviews and/or chart audits for a high volume medical practice (nice-to-have)    Experience with setting team objectives, driving key results, and/or managing staffing (nice-to-have)     This role is right for you if:       You want to leverage your clinical expertise in urgent/primary care to help build technology-driven solutions.    You want to scale your impact and drastically improve the efficiency, safety, and satisfaction of hundreds of thousands of healthcare providers.    You enjoy working in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment that fosters innovation and continuous improvement (without the bureaucracy of traditional healthcare organizations).    You're a creative problem solver capable of thinking in first-principles (resist ""this is how it’s always been done"" thinking).    You're a clear thinker and clear communicator (written and verbal) even on complex and ambiguous issues (especially important in a remote-work environment).    You're a driven ""extreme owner"" who derives joy from achieving goals and consistently delivering excellence.    You have high EQ and can regulate the emotions of yourself and your team, even under pressure.    You're an intuitive leader who naturally keeps a pulse on each team member and knows how to motivate, train/grow, and bring the best out of the people around you.    You want to live and breathe a culture that prioritizes mission over self-interested agendas    You value ego-free decision-making (i.e. the best ideas rather than the loudest voices).    You treat others the way you'd like to be treated.     Why you might not be excited about us       We're small (~20 people in the company now), so if you like more established companies, it's not (yet) the right time. You'll help build our company's culture.    Since we're an early stage startup, projects and priorities may shift.    Our customers love us, and there's a lot we can improve. It's a great place to be, but means there are some parts of our product and tooling that will naturally evolve in the coming months.    Since you'll have a lot of responsibility and creativity over projects, they may not be defined perfectly initially. You'll be expected to bring your own experience and perspective to help us do the right things, and raise flags if you think we should do things differently.

The role of the Engineering Manager is also a support role, with the goal to help their reports to excel in their job. They are the primary point of contact for them to come to with any difficulties that they are facing. They must understand how teams are performing and where improvements can be made.   What we offer:       Remote Working with a flexible schedule, supported by a strong culture of asynchronous communication.    A well-prepared, gentle onboarding experience, and time to learn and grow comfortable with our systems, processes, and people.

We don't require you to perform any coding challenge and we won't ask any algorithmic or tricky questions. We do want to give you the chance to show us your technical and communication skills in a comfortable and positive environment. We believe the best way to achieve this is for you to prepare some examples of how you’ve been successful in leading engineering teams in your previous roles, and we can have some discussions around it.
