As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems. Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed and would love to share it with you. Our process can be a little bit different from some other companies; we tend to hire data scientists slowly, after we have gotten to know people a little bit, and this job posting is the mechanism for initiating that process. Most of our recent hires were the product of ongoing conversations that resulted in a formal fit when the timing was right for both of us. This does mean we sometimes miss out on potential hires, but we believe there are a lot of good people out there; we are willing to wait not only for the right person, but also for the right timing. It has been a successful recipe so far. . Requirements: What you bring to the table: Now on to the fun of formal requirements-we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. You will need: A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field. For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 3 years of experience managing teams. For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on data science projects. A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance. A bit more informally, though, you should have experience with Python, R, Hadoop, Spark, Random Forests, Deterministic Forests (jk), Jupyter Notebooks, xkcd, Deep Learning, and a host of other tools and techniques: you do not need to know them all, but you should be comfortable and capable with quite a few of them. You might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. Why Red Alpha? A few of our perks and benefits: You can retire sooner rather than planned:  Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions. You can have a career AND a life:  Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (up to 25 days of personal time off) and 10 paid holidays. You can stay at your best:  As a member, we'll pay 100% of your premiums for comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance. We'll also pay the majority of the premiums for your family.

Of particular interests are the security of Internet of Things (IoT), sensors networks, wearable devices, mobile phones, robots, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. These IoT devices are most often designed without considering security. Unprotected IoT devices can be used as “stepping stones” by attackers to launch more sophisticated attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). A later stage of APT is the “lateral movement” stage, where attackers use benign computer features to move step-by-step deeper into the network in a stealthy manner.  Emphasis is placed on research related to new techniques for the prediction, prevention, detection, resilience, survival and recovery from IoT attack. This effort pursues mathematical excellence in the following relevant areas which impact IoT cybersecurity: APT; cyber deception; IoT defense-in-depth; and end-to-end determination of security assurance. Theoretical constructs or mathematical abstractions provide a rigorous scientific basis for cyber security because they allow for reasoning quantitatively about cyber-attacks. This opportunity involves the use of several mathematical approaches, including game theory to capture the strategic behavior of malicious adversaries and automatically formulate the optimum policies; graph theory to build and formalize attack-graphs; and adversarial machine learning for adaptation to dynamic change in operating scenario. Limited rationality, incomplete information, imperfect monitoring in distributed networks are among the challenges to be considered.

Come join our collaborative team at Data Tecnica International (DTI) by supporting two great labs at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Stroke (NINDS, Ward and Levine labs). This opportunity focuses on aiding with data processing, management and analysis of dynamic cellular data in the contexts of both cellular and animal models. The minimal qualifications of the candidate is a US citizen (or work permit holder) with some experience in bioinformatics, high performance computing, python programming and a basic knowledge of genomics. Ideally, a master’s degree in bioinformatics, neural computation, computational biology or biomedical data science would be best. This position is open immediately. This position is remote for the duration of at least one year, commensurate with ~1300 hours of work estimated for the calendar year. Please see below for a comprehensive outline of potential duties, responsibilities and background on the collaborative labs. If interested, please send: CV, recommendation contact information and a GitHub link or other code example to info@datatecnica.com. Levine Lab Data Types : All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form. Mouse behavior Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc. Cellular activity (post-hoc): Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers Cellular activity (dynamic): Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the broader population of recorded cells Levine Lab Analysis Goals : Data analysis: Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar) Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position) Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions Recording from different populations of neurons Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types Different behavioral/motivational contexts Developmental age Spinal cord injury Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration Data Modeling: Physical forces/torques/biomechanics Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys) Dynamical systems modeling Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration Levine Lab SOW : Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing. The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative. Levine Lab Background : The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury. To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery. Ward Lab Data Types : Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint Ward Lab Analysis Goals : Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets. Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets) Ward Lab SOW Data analysis (as above) The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI) Ward Lab   Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI: Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible. Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions. Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI. Ward Lab background : The Ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We exclusively use genetically-modified human iPSCs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. iPSCs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. Almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.",30+ days ago,
