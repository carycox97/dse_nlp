From the creator of the popular framework PyTorch Lightning, Grid is a platform for training models that enables rapid research iteration. Grid aims to simplify scalable AI research so that when a network becomes complex, code doesn't.  Focus on Machine Learning, Not Infrastructure.  Grid.ai is backed by $18.6 million in funding from Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Firstminute. Grid is a remote-first company founded by William Falcon and Luis Capelo.  What's important to us  We are building a company of people that care deeply about the impact of AI on our society.

Curiosity: We are genuinely interested in finding solutions to advance the state of AI research and foster its application in novel products. It's not about whether we can solve the problem, but how.

Engineering:  At the end of the day, we are all engineers. We connect with developers in the field, foster strong relationships with internal teams, and work together on prioritizing feedback to inform discovery and roadmap development.  What You'll Do  Amplify the Lightning and Grid Community by connecting with users in the community Slack, speaking at meetups and conferences, and hosting Community Office Hours and Technical Community Sprints.

You will be responsible for coordinating key components of a student's course structure, such as weekly one-on-ones, assessments, and project reviews, and act as their go-to technical resource and inspiration as they work through the program. You'll work with fellow Flatiron School staff to guide students through the course material, build community within our student body, troubleshoot student issues, and overall create productive, inspired, employable practitioners of a technical craft. A cohort Lead needs to be comfortable guiding students through applied and experiential learning activities across a breadth of skill areas that are expected of data science professionals.  Responsibilities:   Work directly with students, elevating them to meet our technical bar.  Maintain the cadence of the course: Keep students on track, monitor each individual's progress, and design and implement learning or service interventions when students fall behind.  Hold regular one-on-one and group coaching sessions with students that serve as tutoring, motivational, or debugging sessions — whatever particular student(s) need(s) that day to keep on track for their goals.  Help students in real-time, through one-on-one meetings, chat, and live video conversations, tending towards the most high-fidelity experiences.  Facilitate Education Operations in Flatiron School's Learning Management System.  Review coursework by students and provide specific, highly qualitative, and useful feedback.  Lead project sprints, helping students scope and execute larger technical projects to demonstrate mastery of each content module  Conduct assessments, holding students to a high bar of mastery for each content module and coaching them on how to deepen their understanding of the material.  Build community within student groups by identifying, creating, and implementing connective experiences, like Feelings Friday and Motivational Monday study groups, Slack discussions, and student pairing sessions.  While lecturing is not an instructor's main responsibility, lecturing may be required occasionally.  Monitor and engage in student discussions, jumping in to help with technical challenges and participating in non-technical conversations that develop community.  Leverage passion as a force for motivation by sharing what you are passionate about with students and working those topics into lesson plans as appropriate.  Be available, responsive, excited, and kind: A teacher who holds students to high standards, puts people above process and creates the kind of learning environment that stretches people beyond what they thought they could achieve.  Use feedback from students gathered via class surveys, team members, and students, to reflect, adjust, and continually improve your practice; assist colleagues in developing and executing learning interventions that move students forward.  Be an exemplar of Flatiron School's values in your work and your interactions: Make No Little Plans, Pursue Mastery, Work Together, Radiate Positivity, Be Scrappy, and Nurture Difference.   Qualifications:   Strong Knowledge in Data Science in Python, starting from data manipulation and management to advanced Machine Learning techniques like Deep Learning.  Strong communication skills, and great judgment about what communications to use in a particular situation or on a particular medium.  Service orientation: You're delighted to help people succeed, whether that's your colleagues at Flatiron School, or the students you're teaching.  The ability to work cross-functionally with a variety of colleagues, from Curriculum Writers to Data Science Lecturers, to Engineers and Designers.

From the creator of the popular framework PyTorch Lightning, Grid is a platform for training models that enables rapid research iteration. Grid aims to simplify scalable AI research so that when a network becomes complex, code doesn't.  Focus on Machine Learning, Not Infrastructure.  Grid.ai is backed by $18.6 million in funding from Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Firstminute. Grid is a remote-first company founded by William Falcon and Luis Capelo.  What's important to us  We are building a company of people that care deeply about the impact of AI on our society.

We empower our community, clients, and colleagues to tackle the impossible.  Curiosity: We are genuinely interested in finding solutions to advance the state of AI research and foster its application in novel products. It's not about whether we can solve the problem, but how.  We also feel that it's essential to point out the self-evident here – there's a genuine lack of diversity in our industry, which has to change. One of our goals is to help drive that change. Grid.ai is fully committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of its practices, especially when it comes to growing our team. Our culture promotes inclusion, and we embrace how rewarding it is to work with people from all walks of life.

VP of Strategy Interview - 45 minutes:  As a data scientist himself, our VP of Strategy has evaluated almost every machine learning platform out there, so this interview will be more of a role-playing exercise. Based on what you know about our core product, you will act as if Marc is a potential customer and you are already our first Solutions Architect.

Background Immunai was founded in December 2018. We are a multidisciplinary team of immunologists, genomics technologists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians and operators singularly focused on solving an audacious challenge. Backed by some of the leading scientific minds in immunology, oncology, and single cell genomics, we are up for the challenge. Immunai has begun the process of mapping millions of immune cells and their functions in order to build a proprietary data set for clinical immunological data. The immune system mapping will play an important role in boosting R&D efforts in developing targeted therapies for different diseases. The company noted that the immune system consists of trillions of cells that are divided into different cell types that perform different functions. Because of the complexity of the system, it can be difficult to determine how drugs will interact with the immune cells. This increased understanding can be used to boost clinical response to different cellular therapies. Immunai’s mission is to map the immune system with neural networks and transfer learning techniques informed by deep immunology knowledge. We developed the tools and know-how to help every immuno-oncology and cell therapy researcher excel at their job.
