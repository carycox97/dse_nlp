https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=48d173b06bccab63&from=web&vjs=3,470,"Associate Director, Undergraduate Program in Data Science & Social Systems",Stanford University,"Stanford, CA","Stanford is launching a new undergraduate major in Data Science & Social Systems, designed for students who want to work at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences. Students in the program will develop a rigorous understanding of methods and approaches from computer science and statistics, alongside knowledge in area domains from the social sciences through a set of core courses. They will learn to apply technical tools to address substantive problems in areas such as public policy, sociology, political science, psychology and economics. Students will develop multiple fluencies: in computational methods, in domain knowledge and applications of social science broadly, and in the moral and political frameworks that shape social systems and illuminate the value trade-offs that are an inevitable part of social decision making. The degree is intended to prepare students for work in a range of industries that require integrating quantitative thinking with an understanding of human behavior or public policy and for careers in the public and social sectors where data-intensive approaches are increasingly prized. We are building out the leadership team of the new program now, as we prepare for its official launch in Fall 2022.  The degree is closely tied to a major new university initiative, Stanford Impact Labs, which is developing a new model of R&D for impact-focused social science. Stanford Impact Labs (SIL) is building on what works in the life sciences and engineering to turn academic discovery into medical advances and new technologies people use: significant multi-year investments in research and development cycles, and close partnerships between academics and leaders outside the university. As part of their degree programs, students will have the opportunity to hone and deploy their skills in the context of partnerships with public and social sector organizations.  Please submit a resume and cover letter through Stanford’s Career Portal.  WHAT YOU’LL DO  The Associate Director will play a pivotal role in shaping and delivering the new major. They will work closely with the Faculty Director to design the curriculum, coordinate new course offerings, develop practicum opportunities, secure internship opportunities, and lead co-curricular cohort activities. They will also be a key mentor to undergraduates in the program, both as an advisor and the leader of the practicum program. As the major is unique in its interdisciplinary and applied orientation, the associate director will work with faculty across Stanford campus and with practitioners outside of Stanford to develop course content and opportunities for students.

We are looking for creative problem solvers with knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, and, more generally, with experience in scientific computing, evidenced by publications and codes. Knowledge and experience in Bayesian statistics and uncertainty quantification are also desirable. The work mainly involves the design of new machine learning algorithms for the prediction of material structure and properties, for given physical process conditions. It also includes the design and implementation of efficient optimal experimental design methods, in both deterministic and Bayesian settings. The position will involve extensive interaction with a large and diverse project team, code development and analysis, and demonstration of the developed technology in multiple applications. This project is focused on discovering new resilient materials and manufacturing processes via an artificial-intelligence-guided approach.

Security Clearance   This position does not currently require a Department of Energy (DOE) security clearance. Sandia will conduct a pre-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause access to be denied or terminated, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment. If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted. Members of the workforce (MOWs) hired at Sandia who require uncleared access for greater than 179 days during their employment, are required to go through the Uncleared Personal Identity Verification (UPIV) process. Access includes physical and/or cyber (logical) access, as well as remote access to any NNSA information technology (IT) systems. UPIV requirements are not applicable to individuals who require a DOE personnel security clearance for the performance of their SNL employment or to foreign nationals. The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) and OF-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.

Position Information   This postdoctoral position is a temporary position for up to one year, which may be renewed at Sandia's discretion up to five additional years. The PhD must have been conferred within five years prior to employment. Individuals in postdoctoral positions may bid on regular Sandia positions as internal candidates, and in some cases may be converted to regular career positions during their term if warranted by ongoing operational needs, continuing availability of funds, and satisfactory job performance.",7 days ago,256 reviews
