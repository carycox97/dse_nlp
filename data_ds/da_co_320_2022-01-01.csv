Sanborn is looking for a  GIS Analyst II / Python Programmer  to work onsite at a federal agency   with technical skills in two areas: 1) ecologically focused geospatial modeling and analysis, and 2) data quality and standards evaluation. The position will emphasize working with and developing data at multiple spatial and temporal scales, using advanced spatial analysis techniques (i.e. Map Algebra, Reclassify, Extraction, etc.) and geostatistical methods (i.e. Neighborhood Statistics, Summary Statistics, etc.). Travel of one or two trips per year may be required. This position is located in Denver, Colorado. The federal agency recognizes that the public lands are facing increasingly complex and widespread environmental challenges that transcend traditional management boundaries. These challenges include managing wildfire; controlling weeds and insect outbreaks; providing for energy development and urban growth; and addressing pervasive impacts from the effects of climate change. The agency is developing a landscape-scale management approach to better understand these challenges and support balanced stewardship of the diverse natural resources of the public lands. A landscape approach looks across these larger areas to more fully recognize natural resource conditions and trends, natural and human influences, and opportunities for resource conservation, restoration, and development. It seeks to identify important ecological values and patterns of environmental change that may not be evident when managing smaller, local land areas. Examples of landscape-level initiatives include Greater-Sage Grouse Plan Implementation (GRSG), Rapid Ecoregional Assessments (REAs), and the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring Strategy (AIM). These initiatives require analysis, modeling, and application of geospatial data, in particular ecological data, at multiple spatial and temporal scales. They also require quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) of geospatial data, models and tools to ensure data standards are met. REQUIRED EXPERIENCE:  Bachelor’s degree in a natural resources field such as, but not limited to, ecology, natural resources management, wildlife biology, botany, forestry, fisheries, soils, etc. from an accredited university. 1.

Professional experience  consolidating data  from multiple sources to a single data set. This can include creating, managing, and maintaining geospatial databases (including Esri file and SDE geodatabases). Professional knowledge of concepts and principles of geospatial  data management . Professional experience writing  FGDC and/or ISO metadata  for vector and/or raster products. Experience in developing written  technical documentation  (such as metadata, workflow diagrams, white papers, etc.). Ability to  communicate technical information  effectively to lay persons and geospatial technical experts alike. Ability to work with projects of  varying timelines  from yearlong implementation schedules to products with hours for quick turnaround production. TASKS:  Conduct geospatial analysis  using a wide-range of thematic data, with a focus on ecological data (e.g., wildlife, vegetation, hydrology, climate change), working at multiple spatial and temporal scales; use advanced spatial analysis techniques, including geostatistical methods, to analyze data and develop custom tools or analysis methods. Develop and troubleshoot custom geospatial models and geoprocessing tools  that are fully functional, transferable, documented, and meet specifications for internal distribution and external publication. Generate all geospatial data and products (e.g., maps, map services, Webapps, models, tools and databases) in  ESRI ArcGIS 10.x  and approved extensions/add-ons such as Geocortex, Fragstats, and CircuitScape. * Develop or update documentation *on geospatial models, tools and processes to: 1) Make sure the lay user can understand and run the models and processes, 2) Improve the content to better document the models/processes (i.e., add more detail, references, visual diagrams), 3) Standardize the documents’ format, and 4) Ensure that the documents meet standards such as meeting 508-compliance standards. * Use ecological expertise *to interpret and apply geospatial data, maps or other products.
