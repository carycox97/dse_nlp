https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=be455a6c6694304f&from=web&vjs=3,20,OCT Image Processing and Machine Learning Fellowship,The Tearney Lab,"Boston, MA 02114","The Tearney Lab at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, MA USA  Until recently, visualizing the architectural and cellular morphology of human tissue has required histopathological examination. Samples would be excised from the patient, processed, sectioned, stained and viewed under a microscope. In addition to being invasive, time consuming and costly, the static nature of conventional pathology prohibits the study of biological dynamics and function. The Tearney Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital has led the way in transforming the current diagnostic paradigm through the invention and translation of new noninvasive, high-resolution optical imaging modalities that enable disease diagnosis from living patients without excising tissues from the body.  Led by Guillermo (Gary) Tearney, MD, PhD, the lab’s 80+ person multidisciplinary team invents, validates and translates novel devices that use light to conduct microscopy in living patients. Light is uniquely well suited for noninvasively interrogating the microscopic structure, molecular composition and biomechanical properties of biological tissues. The goal of the laboratory’s research is to improve understanding and diagnosis of disease by imaging the human body at the highest possible level of detail in vivo.   Job Description A Postdoctoral research fellowship in optical coherence tomography (OCT) machine learning classification is available in the Tearney Lab (www.tearneylab.org) at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the Wellman Center for Photomedicine.

The initiative formed a dynamic, 5-year partnership between the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Florida State University (FSU) to both impact early literacy and build a process for the successful integration of research and practice. Reach Every Reader has 5 principal work streams: Pre-K Home and Family Engagement, K-3 Screening and Assessment, K-3 Intervention, Collaboration and Reach, and Integration for Scale.               Part of Reach Every Reader, ReadNet is a recently funded project focused on language processing. The project respects that reading skill is essential for academic success, but many children fall behind and never catch up in reading skill due to learning differences (such as dyslexia) or opportunity differences (poverty). Further, changes in educational practices and policies and innovations in technology have not had a demonstrable effect on reading skill over the past 20 years and have not closed gaps in reading skill for children with learning differences or children from lower socioeconomic strata or children of color.              The ReadNet project proposes to create an open database with unique educational value for improving reading outcomes in US children. The database will include annotated speech samples taken from kindergartners being screened for risk for future reading difficulty and the ground truth of whether those children become good or poor readers in 3d grade. This will allow Kaggle competitions to (1) have speech recognition make in-school screening of all children be efficient, valid, scalable, and equitable, and (2) predict from kindergarten speech data which children progress to good or poor reading (so that immediate support can be given to children otherwise fated to struggle with reading).               We are seeking a Research Assistant to join the Reach Every Reader Team with a focus on the ReadNet project. The Research Assistant will support our researchers in addressing challenges at the intersection of dyslexia, speech production, and machine learning. This individual will join a world-class team of neuroscientists and cognitive scientists focused on improving speech recognition for children’s speech and discovering potential predictors of dyslexia.                                 Position Description             Reporting to the Sr. Associate Director of Reach Every Reader, the Research Assistant’s chief responsibilities we be as follows:                     Develop and maintain a database of speech recordings and associated metadata;         Maintain project documentation;         Collaborate and coordinate across a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Florida State University’s Center for Reading Research;         Provide support to researchers by running analytic tools on data in a cluster or cloud environment.

Phoenix Charter Academy was founded on the unwavering belief that all students can succeed at high levels. While this mantra is typical of high-performing schools, particularly those in the charter sector, Phoenix truly endeavors to reach every student, focusing on a growing number on the margins of the traditional public district education system: students who have dropped out of high school, students who are parenting children of their own, students who are or have been involved with the juvenile justice system, students who are older and new to the country and cannot gain access to public schooling, and students who are under-credited relative to the number of years they have spent enrolled in high school. We believe that these students, like all students, are completely capable of developing the skills necessary to set themselves up for lifetimes of economic prosperity and success. We support our students with individually tailored and academically rigorous curricula and push them to succeed at the highest levels by providing them with the resources and mentoring that they need to reach their full potential.        Why Our Work is Important     Students across America are dropping out of high school at an alarming rate. Dropping out of high school has a substantial impact on a young person’s life. Over the course of their lifetime, an individual who drops out of high school is more likely to have reduced earning power, greater social service dependency, increased rates of criminal involvement, and shorter life expectancy. Phoenix Charter Academies addresses this trend by creating environments where students can demonstrate their talent and resilience and prepare themselves for success through high school, college, and beyond.        Commitment to DEI     At Phoenix, we recognize the importance of forming a school community inclusive of all visible and invisible identities. We act to ensure that our students and staff always see reflections of themselves and their communities.        At Phoenix, we aim to break down systemic barriers by providing access to resources, experiences, and differentiated supports for historically marginalized groups.        At Phoenix, we solicit, value, understand, connect, and leverage multiple perspectives and experiences. We invite all perspectives except those that perpetuate oppression or dehumanization.        At Phoenix we do not just accept difference - we celebrate it, support it, and thrive on it for the benefit of our scholars and the communities we serve. We believe difference makes us stronger. Phoenix Charter Academy is an equal opportunity employer and as such, we do not discriminate against any team member or candidate because of race, creed, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, or any other basis protected by federal, state or local law. Phoenix Charter Academy is committed to making any reasonable accommodation necessary to support an individual's employment.

The Villani laboratory is also affiliated to the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard, offering additional opportunities to collaborate and bridge with this vibrant community.      This position offers the opportunity to employ the cutting-edge of computational biology, machine learning and statistical research to solve important problems in health and disease related to the human immune system, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Single cell genomics is revolutionizing our understanding of biology – from redefining our understanding of the types of cells, a fundamental unit in biology, to translating this knowledge to better understand disease phenotypes and the implications of this to therapeutics. We are looking for a highly motivated and talented individual with a computational background to join our efforts. This position represents an exciting opportunity to work as a member of an interdisciplinary team of biologists, laboratory scientists, computational biologists, and physicians working together on transformative translational efforts that are bridging between the clinical and research interfaces.

Our world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students, faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the confines of discipline, degree, and campus.           Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London; Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system. Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible, student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused research.           Northeastern’s comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and careers.                                            About the Opportunity:                                 In response to the shortage of researchers trained in AI, Northeastern seeks research faculty at all levels from computer science and other fields related to Artificial intelligence.

We develop structural bioinformatics and machine-learning techniques to compute the structures and sequences of proteins that bind to challenging small-molecule ligands. We then express these proteins in the lab and characterize them with biophysical and structural methods (see, e.g., Polizzi and DeGrado,  Science  2020). We aim not only to unlock the design principles used by proteins for molecular recognition but also to make useful proteins for probing and manipulating biology. By designing de novo small-molecule-binding proteins, we can isolate the essential ingredients for protein molecular recognition events, obtain atomic-level control of the protein/small-molecule interface, and set the stage for the development of proteins that could serve as novel sensors, enzymes, drug delivery vehicles, or pharmaceuticals.      Our lab (http://polizzilab.org/) at Dana-Farber’s Longwood Center has access to state-of-the-art facilities, including for cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, flow cytometry, and high-performance computing. We are part of a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary environment within the Chemical Biology program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School. We collaborate with leading biologists and physician scientists to pursue high impact applications of protein design for understanding and controlling biology.      Located in Boston and the surrounding communities, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute brings together world renowned clinicians, innovative researchers and dedicated professionals, allies in the common mission of conquering cancer, HIV/AIDS and related diseases.

Ready to make a difference? Make yourself at home with us and start doing  your life's best work.(sm)           Optum Labs is the research and development arm of UnitedHealth Group. We're a diverse team of curious thinkers and experts in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and scientific and clinical research searching for new ways to help people live healthier lives. We partner with world leaders in health care delivery, research, and technology to create disruptive solutions that serve patients, caregivers, providers, and commercial and government payers.
