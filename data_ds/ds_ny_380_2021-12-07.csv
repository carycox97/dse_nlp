Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and nearly 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.  The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors and 100 minors offered through 13 schools and colleges; nearly 15,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit www.syracuse.edu.   About the Syracuse area  Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.

You'll collaborate with our world class EPD team led by veterans who have held senior product and engineering positions early on at companies like Dropbox ($10B+) and Common (raised $100m+)to shape the direction of our shipper offering and internal tools, in an industry where the average customer NPS is negative or very low, and where most internal processes do not rely on modern software tools to unlock revenue growth and a superior customer experience.

You will be responsible for coordinating key components of a student's course structure, such as weekly one-on-ones, assessments, and project reviews, and act as their go-to technical resource and inspiration as they work through the program. You'll work with fellow Flatiron School staff to guide students through the course material, build community within our student body, troubleshoot student issues, and overall create productive, inspired, employable practitioners of a technical craft.

Responsibilities:   Work directly with students, elevating them to meet our technical bar.  Maintain the cadence of the course: Keep students on track, monitor each individual's progress, and design and implement learning or service interventions when students fall behind.  Hold regular one-on-one and group coaching sessions with students that serve as tutoring, motivational, or debugging sessions — whatever particular student(s) need(s) that day to keep on track for their goals.

Monitor and engage in student discussions, jumping in to help with technical challenges and participating in non-technical conversations that develop community.  Leverage passion as a force for motivation by sharing what you are passionate about with students and working those topics into lesson plans as appropriate.  Be available, responsive, excited, and kind: A teacher who holds students to high standards, puts people above process and creates the kind of learning environment that stretches people beyond what they thought they could achieve.  Use feedback from students gathered via class surveys, team members, and students, to reflect, adjust, and continually improve your practice; assist colleagues in developing and executing learning interventions that move students forward.  Collaborate with the Central Data Science Education team and Data Science Lecturers to deliver feedback from students and staff about what resources and improvements would drive the best student experiences.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=e76d22376dba3145&from=web&vjs=3,530,"Data Scientist, Product",Splice.com,New York State,"About the role  After recently expanding Splice's offerings—first-party creator tools (Astra, Beatmaker, and Bridge) and education content (Skills)—we are looking for someone who can unlock greater understanding in how users adopt and engage with these areas of our product. We're interested in creating a unified, cohesive, and intuitive experience across our product ecosystem, so this role will require close collaboration with teams that oversee the core, cross-surface experience of our Sounds marketplace.  Day to day this means balancing ad hoc data exploration and longer-running analytical projects; designing and conducting experiments; survey analysis; bridging the gap between Product Managers and Data Engineers to assure that data are accessible and easy to use for self-service reporting; and creating the essential metrics, reporting, and dashboards so the Product team and company have insight into the above-mentioned feature areas.  Why Splice?  Music starts at Splice. As a collection of artists, producers, creators and collaborators, Splice sweats every detail involved in the creative process. From our expansive library of content, to the tools we provide, to our company work culture, we're constantly evolving towards being the best advocates for our artists and employees. If you work at Splice you'll be asked, ""what does music mean to you?"" That's because music is at the core of everything we do. It's why we hire trailblazers to help us solve problems, navigate uncharted territory, and change the industry for the better. It's why we seek out diversity in who we hire, represent and collaborate with to ensure that we're growing towards a more inclusive and open minded reality. And it's why we hold ourselves accountable for our part in shaping music creation.  Skills we're looking for:  Data manipulation  We expect our Data Scientists to have strong analytical SQL skills. This means fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions. This role will work with large-scale data, so this person must have experience writing efficient, performance-optimized queries.  Metric creation  This individual will be responsible for taking in loosely structured problems or objectives and devising useful metrics that drive us toward solutions. This process will require taking on a user-centric perspective to identify key behavioral patterns in our products and translate these into metrics that will be used in decision making—in a sense, choosing the optimal methodology while also thoughtfully constructing scalable and intuitive user interfaces for whatever metric or analysis is built.  Analysis  Most problems benefit from models that can be interpreted to drive human action. We're seeking an individual who enjoys experimentation and statistical analysis—someone who can translate what they see in the data into useful product recommendations. A thorough understanding of statistical inference is required.  Technical requirements  Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, or a similar MPP data warehouse).  Hands-on experience with self-service analytics tools ( e.g. , Looker, Mixpanel, Tableau).  Training in statistics or econometrics, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies.  Familiarity with a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (preferably Python).  Exposure to a variety of data sets used for product analytics—chiefly, large-scale event data ( e.g. , Mixpanel, Segment, GA 360, or Snowplow) and normalized transactional databases ( e.g. , e-commerce or subscription datasets).  Additional comments  There are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.  As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is definitely an asset. If this topic is new to you, that's okay—you should be open to learning about it.  Equal Opportunity Employer:  Splice is an equal opportunity employer, committed to diversity and inclusiveness.
