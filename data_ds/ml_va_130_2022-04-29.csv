Founded in December 2018, we've rapidly grown to almost 2 million customers.  It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.  We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.  We get it -  life happens . That's why Mission Lane is hard at work paving a better way forward.
