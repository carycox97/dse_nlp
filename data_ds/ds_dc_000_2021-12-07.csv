You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.  The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""  Us  The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.  Your Day  While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:   Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.  Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.  Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.  Taking the models we build into production.

As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.  Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods . These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.  Strong programming skills . Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.  Strong exploratory data analysis skills . Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.  Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset.  We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.  At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field . This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged. This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.

Widespread adoption of existing energy-efficiency (EE) building technologies – and the introduction and use of new technologies – could eventually reduce energy use in homes and commercial buildings by 50 percent. This would save almost $200 billion annually on energy bills and help create jobs. BTO’s mission is to support research and development (R&D), validation, and integration of affordable, energy-saving technologies, strategies, analytical tools, and information services to enable industry and others to deploy these at scale to reduce energy use and cost in both new and existing residential and commercial buildings.  In addition to EE, Buildings Technologies Office (BTO) has several additional co-emphases. An important one is demand-flexibility (DF), a building’s ability to responsively shape its electricity draw at time scales ranging from multiple hours to seconds and even sub-seconds in order to support grid stability, reliability, and the efficient use of a variety of generation resources. Grid-interactive Efficient Buildings (GEB) is a cross-cutting BTO initiative aimed at establishing building-based DF as a key grid asset. Other emerging co-emphases include resilience, embodied energy, EE and DF at the neighborhood scale, and a new focus on technologies and strategies that support the building construction and deep renovation process; the latter is led by the Advanced Building Construction (ABC) initiative.  BTO’s Emerging Technologies (ET) Program aims to enable the development of cost-effective technologies that can reduce building energy use intensity by 45 percent by 2030, relative to 2010 EE technologies. The ET Program works towards this goal by supporting early-stage R&D in component technologies for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC&R) and water heating; solid-state lighting; and windows and opaque building envelope. The ET Program also has sub-programs in integration technology areas including Sensors and Controls (S&C).  Machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) are playing increasingly large roles in many sectors and are beginning to make an impact in buildings sectors as well with applications in building control, grid response, equipment and system-level fault detection and diagnostics, measurement and verification (M&V), demand forecasting, planning, and others. BTO’s ET Program seeks a talented and committed individual to help it enhance and expand its use of machine learning and data science throughout its portfolio.  Through this appointment, you will learn how to:  Participate in technical reviews/assessments of proposed research and development plans, conduct technical and economic feasibility analysis, as well as evaluate at a deep technical level the progress and ongoing viability and success potential of projects toward meeting the BTO energy efficiency goals. This includes periodic technical reviews and providing rigorous technical feedback for funded R&D projects; as well as collaborating in the negotiation of statements of work and project management plans with technically rigorous milestones, go/no-go decision points, stage-gates and deliverables for new awards.  Collaborate with BTO staff in the assessment of the state-of-the-art scientific literature and practice in machine learning and data science in building applications and in evaluating the potential of machine learning and data science in various building applications.  Collaborate with BTO staff in developing short, medium, and long term strategies and goals for the use of machine learning and data science in building applications.  Engage integration of BTO’s machine learning and data science activities with other efforts across EERE, DOE, and with external stakeholders.   Selected participants will receive a stipend as support for their living and other expenses during this appointment. Stipend rates are determined by EERE officials and are based on the candidate’s academic and professional background.

With experts in software engineering, bioinformatics and program management, we focus on developing and applying technology tools and techniques to empower decision-making and accelerate the discovery in translational research. We work with some of the top research organizations and facilities in the country including multiple institutes at the National Institutes of health (NIH).  Axle  is seeking a highly ambitious, adaptable, structured, and detail oriented  Research Associate  to join our rare disease informatics team at Bethesda. The ideal candidate is willing to work between 30-40 hours per week and has the desire to have NIH listed on their resume. Currently, there are about 7,000-10,000 known rare diseases that affect people in the US, yet only a few hundred (less than 5%) have a treatment and even fewer a cure. A rare disease is defined in US law (Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983,[1] Rare Diseases Act (RDA) of 2002[2]) as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Most rare diseases affect far fewer patients than this, with most rare diseases affecting only a few hundreds to thousands of patients. Collectively, however, rare diseases are not rare at all, and in total are estimated to affect as many as 25-30 million patients in the US, making rare diseases a large public health consideration. The ORDR’s GARD information center was established in 2003 under a Congressional Mandate (RDA 2002), and is a federally funded program that has an essential role in the dissemination of public health information to rare disease researchers, clinicians, and patients that is freely accessible to the public. However, obtaining accurate, comprehensive, timely, and objective information on rare diseases is often difficult, given the large number of rare diseases, rapidly evolving science (especially related to genomics), diverse data sources, and inconsistent nomenclature and ontologies for rare disease classification, among other issues. Recently, GARD has been undergoing a re-envisioning and re-design based on a Neo4j knowledge graph database that integrates rare disease data from multiple sources to keep the information on ~6,000 different rare diseases in GARD up-to-date and useful to the patient and clinical research communities. Research tools, artificial intelligent models, data visualization and informatics infrastructure based on the knowledge graph database will be developed to support rare diseases research and clinical activities, and to answer rare disease research questions likely to inform rare disease research prioritization. [1] Orphan Drug Act of 1983, amended for prevalence 1984. Pub.L. 97-414 [2] Rare Diseases Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-280 Responsibilities : Work collaboratively with data scientists and application developers to develop informatics infrastructure and support for rare diseases research. Query the existing GARD knowledge graph database for rare diseases data, such as disease classification/ontologies coding (e.g., ICD 10), genetics, clinical characteristics/phenotypic information, diagnosis, and treatment, among others. Collect, quality check, process and integrate data from publicly available data and information resources. Develop a Neo4j database for data management. Develop APIs for user access to the existing knowledge graph database. Apply machine learning and/or natural language processing approaches for data mapping and knowledge extraction. Qualifications: Associate or Bachelor’s degree or enrolled in an accredited Associate or Bachelor’s degree program n Computer Science, Data Science, Bioinformatics, Information Systems or a related field. Good understanding of principles and concepts in database management and software development. Familiarity with Linux/Unix operating system. Familiarity with one or more programing languages, such as Python, Perl, Java etc. Experience in database management, web application and/or API development is preferred.
