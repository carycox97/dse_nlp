Both leverage the commander's singular vision and guidance; develop plans to meet challenges in the same strategic and operational environments; build complementary mission approaches; and share a common goal of defense of the United States and Canada.  Our competitors have analyzed our ability to operate overseas and have invested in capabilities such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, small unmanned aircraft systems, artificial intelligence, cyber capabilities, and delivery platforms to offset our strengths while exploiting our perceived weaknesses. These advancing capabilities embolden competitors and adversaries to challenge us at home, looking to threaten our people, our critical infrastructure and our power projection capabilities.  These challenges have generated a strong demand for not only changes in operations, but changes in the corresponding education and training programs supporting force employment, development, and design. You will join a team that performs analysis, assessment and integration in support of the Joint Training, Exercises, and Wargaming Directorate (N&NC/J7). We, collectively, provide the commands’ analytical methodology, to include Modeling & Simulation (M&S), necessary to develop and improve requirements-based training and readiness programs and ensure integration with the global DoD Joint Training community, interagency, and international partners. Our team provides the analytical capability to enhance command resources and readiness, augment (N&NC) training and exercise programs with correlated data resulting from in-depth analyses of real-world events, and inform future Joint Training Plans.

Tasks to be performed:  You will work collaboratively with other team members to collect, assess, and compile previously conducted collective training events, Defense Readiness Reporting System reports, Joint Training Information Management System data, identified best practices, and applicable real world lessons learned. Areas for investigation include: modeling and simulation program, training readiness, N&NC Command Center Qualification Training, Joint Task Force Commander Training Course, Joint Force Headquarters/Joint Task Force Staff Training Course, Dual Status Commander Orientation Course, and Defense Support of Civil Authorities Executive Seminar, Arctic issues, Tri-Command Staff Talks, Public-Private-Partnership needs, international and interagency information sharing, and other programs related to developing an integrated layered defense.  You will apply standardized, rigorous, structured methodologies to create and validate a physical, mathematical, or otherwise logical representation of a system, entity, phenomenon, or process. You will incorporate the use of models (e.g. emulators, prototypes, simulations, simulators, and stimulators), either statically or dynamically, to develop data as a basis for making managerial, technical, strategic, or tactical decisions. You will conduct data analysis of a variety of systems (some cloud based) to help develop business decision support tools.  You will apply engineering and/or analytical disciplines required to analyze real-world operational lessons-learned data resulting in recommended changes to training venues to mitigate identified shortfalls. You will further assist the team in identifying, assessing, experimenting, and testing solutions resulting from the studies and analyses accomplished to generate improvements in J7 managed programs and business processes.
