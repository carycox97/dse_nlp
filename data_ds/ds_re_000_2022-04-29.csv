The team draws from a variety of backgrounds in Computer Science & Engineering, Statistics, Economics, Math, Operations Research, and Financial Engineering. We derive strength from this diversity and are constantly learning and teaching each other in a down-to-earth and dynamic environment. We are neither too big where you would be just another cog in the system, nor are we too small that none of our efforts can be realized.                  As a Data Scientist in Wealthfront’s Data Science organization, you’ll be responsible for improving the quality of our decisions using data and the scientific method. Your work will generate tools and insights that inform product and business decisions throughout the company and across the product lifecycle, from ideation and research to launch and iteration. You will mentor and collaborate with your data science colleagues with a focus on technical skills and career development. We are fortunate to work with experienced product managers and engineers that have worked on products at companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple.

What you'll do             Work closely with cross-functional teams of product managers and engineers, translating open-ended business issues into data questions, identifying practical approaches including A/B testing to answer them, and carrying out timely and well-documented analyses that influence our product and company strategy  Design and develop data products to assist consumers with decisions around investments, banking, and financial planning  Continuously look for, and execute upon, opportunities to improve the quality of our data, infrastructure and products  Understand and communicate a data-driven picture of our clients, product and business  Promote automation of repetitive tasks and the creation of tools over ad hoc analyses, making your insights available to anyone that can benefit from them                          What we're looking for             Knowledge of Python and SQL toolchain to access, transform, visualize, and model business data  A firm foundation in data analysis basics including regression and classification models, experiment design, time series modeling and hypothesis testing  Ability and empathy to explain technical and statistical work to business stakeholders  Interest and ability to map business requirements and priorities to technical projects  Interest in continuous learning and mentoring others  BS, MS, or PhD in computer science, mathematics, statistics, economics or related field                         Everyone across the financial spectrum deserves to live secure and rewarding lives.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.                  About       Wealthfront                   Our first chapter was about transforming the investment advisory business. We focused on unlocking access to low cost investing for delegators - people who were underserved by high fee and human financial advisors. We built the first automated portfolio that allows you in seconds to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies for a remarkably low fee, which resulted in attracting more than $25 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry.                  Now, we’ve embarked on expanding into an adjacent opportunity to transform the digital self-directed brokerage space. This focus enables us to empower a dramatically wider audience to build long-term wealth - people who are eager to learn about investing by making their own investment decisions, but need guidance. In the last few years, several financial technology companies have made it incredibly accessible and engaging to trade in individual stocks, but because of their transaction based business models, these apps keep people focused on the day-to-day gyrations of the market leading to short-term thinking and behaviors. As a result, millions of people are investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks which is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We believe our vision serves their needs far better and that we can extend our core philosophy of embracing diversification, managing risk, minimizing fees and taxes and taking a long-term view, into self-directed investing. We believe this is an ideal opportunity to leverage our strength of building simple, easy-to-use products that offer a delightfully engaging experience to build long-term wealth.

We employ a wide variety of models, such as Bayesian models for predicting customer lifetime value, matrix factorization to identify a customer’s product affinity, and reinforcement learning models to optimize content, timing, and frequency of marketing communications.   Our models operate at scale and crunch through millions of data points to make decisions that have been shown to double revenue and triple reach, and are designed in a flexible manner to generalize across our set of 400+ diverse customers who span industries from apparel to automotive. To explore, build, deploy, and maintain models we leverage many tools such as BigQuery, Spark, Cloud SQL, Keras, TensorFlow, Airflow, Kubernetes, and Google Compute Engine.

Every year, billions of dollars, hundreds of megatons of carbon and millions of person-hours are wasted because the companies who ship goods and the companies who carry them aren’t upfront about their needs and abilities. Our platform finds ways for buyers and sellers to contract binding commitments for plannable and predictable freight and allows those contracts to be traded when needs change. In time, Leaf will become the hub through which the trillion-dollar American freight market is managed.

What does an applied data scientist do at Leaf?

Be humble in the face of data, but tenacious in asserting the facts you know.                      Be willing to work with people you disagree with; be eager for criticism, and constantly searching for ways to do what you do better. Never be content with things the way they are, but don’t let the quest for something perfect prevent you from shipping something good.

More about Mission Lane:  Mission Lane is based in the U.S., with offices in Richmond, Virginia & San Francisco, California. Founded in December 2018, we've rapidly grown to almost 2 million customers.  It all started with a realization: nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn't have access to a clear line of credit. And by ""clear"" we mean credit without crazy fees that only increase debt. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-prime credit scores or no score at all. We decided this just wouldn't do.  We understand that everyone doesn't have the same opportunities. We also know that everyone joins us at different stages of their financial journeys. Providing access to clear credit was a critical first step, but our work isn't done. We are actively developing new products designed to meet our customers where they are, according to their needs.  We get it -  life happens . That's why Mission Lane is hard at work paving a better way forward.

This extends to our employees: we have a long and proud history of encouraging and enabling the people who work here to take advantage of O’Reilly’s resources and network to keep learning, take on new challenges, and build careers. O’Reilly Media has two main offices, in Boston and Sebastopol (San Francisco Bay Area), with a large portion of our employees working remotely.  Learn More   About your team  Data drives much of what we at O’Reilly Media do, making the Data Science Team central to how the company operates and continues to grow its influence. We provide business analysis and reporting, build machine learning models, develop prototypes for data-intensive components to the platform, and maintain data systems. We are a distributed team working remotely from home offices, but we place a strong emphasis on teamwork and collaboration: an ideal candidate is one that is both self-motivated and enjoys working with others. Team members are encouraged to learn new skills and technologies as they relate to our mission. We believe work should be fun and friendly, and we hold dear our core belief in maintaining a healthy work-life balance.   About the Job  We have an opening for a Data Scientist who will perform a variety of analyses and data tasks to support core business capabilities such as marketing, sales and product improvements.  Both quantitative and qualitative aspects of analysis are important to this role. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibilities include pulling, cleaning, transforming and analyzing both internal and external data, as well as performing more advanced modeling and machine learning tasks. Some of our projects are based on requests from other departments, others are driven by larger data science team goals. Often we are asked to look into fairly open-ended problems, which requires a degree of creativity, curiosity and research skill.  Crucial to this role is seeing the bigger picture: not just following the instructions of a JIRA ticket or request, but realizing the implications and actionable potential of an analysis. The Data Scientist must understand what data we have – or need to obtain – in order to provide significant insights and value to our learning customers and internal organization. This demands creativity and drive to figure out how to get the data, and how to use the data to keep O’Reilly at the forefront of learning.  The Data Scientist works on problems that are core to the company’s mission. Our team is at the forefront of some of the business’s major challenges, for example, understanding and modeling how users progress through content and developing metrics that describe their learning experience. This role has a significant opportunity to positively impact the company through data-driven means.  Most of our analysis is performed in Python and SQL. Our primary data storage systems are based on Postgres, Redshift, MySQL, BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage. The Data Scientist will: Extract, transform and analyze platform and customer data based on requests from product, sales, marketing and executive teams Write code to automate processes for routine data reporting requirements Undertake research to explore more open-ended data problems Effectively present and communicate research results with coherent visualization and actionable recommendations Work with product teams on platform features such as user-facing dashboards, personalization, topic organization, search and content discovery Maintain our backend data ETL processes and automated reporting services Drive the Data Science Team’s impact in the company by taking the initiative with data-driven solutions for company problems About You  You should have a strong foundation in Python programming for data-related tasks, including experience with data science packages such as NumPy and scikit-learn, and strong SQL skills. The level of coding required will go beyond simple scripts and queries: we are always trying to automate the boring stuff with well-designed and efficiently engineered packages of code. Some knowledge of git, unix commands and big data / distributing computing solutions is highly valued.   Key skills and Experience 2+ years in data science / analytics, or equivalent Excellent Python skills Strong SQL skills Personable and able to work with with others in a team Significant experience combining and transforming data Experience with wrangling dirty data Excellent critical thinking skills and the ability to develop creative solutions to challenging problems Ability to create effective data visualizations Excellent written, verbal, and presentation skills Experience with scientific computing and machine learning, especially NumPy, SciPy and scikit-learn Experience working with unstructured text data and performing NLP tasks Comfortable working on a Linux server Self-motivated and ability to work independently when necessary Diversity At O’Reilly, we believe that true innovation depends on hearing from, and listening to, people with a variety of perspectives. We want our whole organization to recognize, include, and encourage people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, sexual orientations, and professional roles.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a massive digital migration for many critical services.

Identity verification that serves only one organization is costly and time-intensive. Separate passwords for each application add to consumer frustration. With ID.me, login and identity credentials move with an individual so they only need to verify once.  ID.me is a federally-certified identity provider at the highest standards NIST has set for consumer identity verification and login. ID.me is one of only four companies in the United States of America certified by the federal government to bind a legal identity to a digital login.

Think: ""data source"", ""data lineage"", ""data transformation"", ""data age and relevance"", ""model consumption"", ""post consumption action"" etc.      Lean toward action and experimentation with a priority towards rapid prototyping.

Strategy before story telling : before we build narratives for our vision and initiatives we prioritize the process of establishing what we’ll do next, why that is the correct thing to do next, and identify risks and trade-offs.

We are long, bullish, and team You— and focus on the results of consecutive intentional decisions.      Systems thinking : we have seen most objective-result organizational behaviors result in fleeting meaningless goals. Rather than a goals-based mindset, we ask you to develop an outcomes-based and diagnostics-based mindset.      Establish clear lines of responsibility:  Document what you're trying to accomplish, why you're trying to accomplish it, and who will be responsible for specific initiatives.      Practice proactive accountability:  we ask you to practice introspection and proactively assume accountability for your decisions.

As an equal opportunity employer, we encourage and welcome people of all backgrounds to apply.   About Vanta  We started Vanta in 2016 as Equifax had lost every American's social security number, Home Depot had leaked its customers' credit card numbers to hackers, and Facebook admitted that it irresponsibly sent user data to third parties who tried to influence the US election. It was clear that security and privacy had become mainstream issues, and that we all increasingly relied on cloud services to store everything from our personal photos to our communications at work.   Vanta's mission is to be the layer of trust on top of these services, and to secure the internet, increase trust in software companies, and keep consumer data safe.   We do this by building an automated head of security for technology companies, and we use that system to both help a company secure itself and to prove their security to others.   If we succeed in our mission, it should feel irresponsible for users to put data into a product that isn't certified by Vanta, and irresponsible for companies to collect data without using Vanta to secure and monitor themselves.   #LI-Remote",6 days ago,

Across our core initiatives of Science and Education, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and advocacy, to progress in our mission of building an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.  Our Values  We believe we can help build a future for everyone.   We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.  We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.  Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.

We are pushing past the limits of classical physics and current supercomputing technology to unlock a new era of computing. Quantum computing has the potential to impact every area of human society for the better. IonQ's computers will soon redefine industries like medicine, materials science, finance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cryptography, and more. IonQ is at the forefront of this technological revolution.   We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist. As Senior Data Scientist, you'll be part of a cross-functional team whose mission is to lead IonQ on its journey to build the world's best quantum computers to solve the world's most complex problems.  Quantum computers require precise control of the qubits to implement logic gate operations needed for computation. Imperfections in the control process, as well as the degradation of the qubits due to coupling to the environment, lead to errors in the gate operations that reduce the accuracy of long quantum computational tasks. Trapped ion qubits are of highest quality and have very long coherence times, however, errors can be introduced by control signals. The use of advanced control signals can reduce these errors and lead to higher-performing quantum computers. We are looking for a data scientist who can work closely with our engineers in collecting and analyzing data from our quantum computers, to devise better control signals that lead to higher performance gate operations.  Responsibilities:   Work with experimental and theoretical physicists, system operators and software engineers to collect and analyze data from IonQ quantum computers to develop deep understanding of the error processes in our qubits and gates  Apply stringent statistical tools, mathematical methods and novel modeling techniques to develop comprehensive and accurate error models for our gates  Devise improved control mechanisms to mitigate the dominant errors in the gates  Develop data analysis tools that embody these methods, to be used by the system to control errors during quantum computer operation  Document the error models and control methods developed in the process  Work closely with the system development team to provide insights in error and control perspective to help build better quantum computers   You'd be a good fit with:   Bachelor's degree in physics, computer science, mathematics, statistics or similar fields, or similar levels of experience - unconventional backgrounds are welcome and encouraged  Over 10 years of experience working with data from quantum systems in understanding and constructing practical error models  Over 5 years of experience in developing data analysis methods or tools relevant to quantum computers or quantum systems  Excellent verbal and written communication skills  Demonstrated ability to write effective data analysis codes to handle large datasets and extract relevant correlation information   You'd be a great fit with:   Ph.D. in Physics, Engineering, Computer Science or related fields  Experience in applying research to relevant industry problems  Demonstrated experience in working with experimental scientists or engineers to apply data analysis techniques to a practical system of interest  Familiarity with qubits, atomic systems and coherent control techniques  Experience in applying machine learning techniques for data analysis problems  Our HQ is located in College Park, Maryland and we are a 15 minute metro ride from Washington DC. We are actively building out teams in the Washington D.C., Seattle, and Boston metro areas and will want to locate you in one of these geographies.

This is a full-time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.     What you’ll do at Artifact:         Develop a deep understanding of what natural language results are considered insightful to our customers and clearly communicate that to the labeling team.

We are long, bullish, and team You— and focus on the results of consecutive intentional decisions.      Systems thinking : we have seen most objective-result organizational behaviors result in fleeting meaningless goals. Rather than a goals-based mindset, we ask you to develop an outcomes-based and diagnostics-based mindset.      Establish clear lines of responsibility:  Document what you're trying to accomplish, why you're trying to accomplish it, and who will be responsible for specific initiatives.      Practice proactive accountability:  we ask you to practice introspection and proactively assume accountability for your decisions.      Remove your ego: w hen your ego is involved you become so internally absorbed that it's difficult to level-up and see what's happening and how you're behaving. Check it at the door.      Work cross functionally:  We don’t tolerate, support, or allow employees, teams, or departments to prioritize job descriptions over the success of the business. We are building a business.
