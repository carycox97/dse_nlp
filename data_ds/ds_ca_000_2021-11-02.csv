The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.  We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is  truly  saying.  We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few. Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants. This role is an  in-house mathematician  role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term. The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results. Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues. We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works. Requirements:  Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis. Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths. Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=771e98e4afeeb6ff&from=web&vjs=3,180,Senior Data Scientist,Span.IO,"San Francisco, CA","The Mission  The electrical grid was built to carry electricity unidirectionally from central fossil fuel plants to end consumers. As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to re-invent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.  To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.  Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.  The Role  We aim to establish the Span panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. Analytics and ML are essential tools to develop features for the smart, green, energy-efficient home of the future. Span's unique ability to monitor and control individual circuits opens up a new avenue for proactive whole-home management and equipment failure detection. As Senior Data Scientist, you will leverage your deep understanding of ML, modeling, and statistics to solve problems including anomaly detection, time series forecasting, and event prediction with the goal to optimally manage whole-home energy consumption, deliver meaningful insights to the customer, and notify them about a potential failure of equipment or hazards in their home. You'll be involved through the entire development process, from the acquisition of all additional third-party data, the initial design to remote monitoring in the field.  Responsibilities  Lead the development of ML algorithms from the ground up which includes:   Gain knowledge in the relevant domain (e.g.common failure modes of appliances)   Feature engineering   Prototype new algorithms   Benchmark performance across large scale datasets   Use your experience with different machine learning frameworks to identify suitable tools for integration in Span's software platform   Integrate developed algorithms in our production code base with robust test coverage   Work with the firmware and software teams to design Span's edge model deployment framework; pick which ML framework Span should adopt   Proactively identify opportunities within Span that can benefit from data science analysis   Use fleet data to monitor algorithms in the field   Note: We're a startup, so while this list is broad, it's still just a start; you'll end up wearing many hats during your time at Span.  About You  Required Qualifications   Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, or a closely related field   4+ years' of professional experience with developing and implementing machine learning models to production   4+ years of Data Scientist experience   Deep understanding machine learning algorithms (anomaly/outlier detection in time series data, time series forecasting, clustering algorithms, probabilistic models)   Advanced Python skills, as well as familiarity with pandas and scikit-learn   Software design experience and ability to write clean, maintainable, and shippable production code   Experience working with SQL and data visualization tools   Extensive data modeling and data architecture skills   Knowledge and experience working within cloud computing environments such as AWS   Strong communication and interpersonal skills   Ability to understand and explain complex problems simply and effectively   Bonus Qualifications   Experience optimizing models for resource-constrained edge devices   Experience in data engineering   Domain-specific knowledge either through previous work, courses in college, or side projects   Life at Span  Span is a startup based in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco.
