We’ve served more than 400 organizations ranging from government agencies, advocacy groups, unions, political campaigns, international groups, and companies. Along the way, we’ve developed some of the most innovative tools available in analytics, media optimization, reporting, and influencer outreach- serving a diverse set of industries, including the automotive, travel, consumer packaged goods, entertainment, healthcare, media, telecom, and more.   The Team:   The BlueLabs Government Analytics practice revolutionizes the way government agencies use data to streamline operations, interact with citizens, and react to their biggest challenges. Our team develops deep expertise within the areas our clients care about most, then builds data analytics systems that create impact at scale. We work closely with internal government innovation groups, and build on the analytics methodology pioneered in e-commerce, advocacy, politics, and consumer finance. You will work on a fast-paced, impact-driven project team charged with intelligently improving the operations powering the policies and programs that hundreds of millions of Americans interact with on a daily basis. Our work builds the frameworks and infrastructure that allows agencies to deal with big public health challenges. We bring definition to challenging problems, creatively identify data sources, then design analytics that accurately measure impact and move the needle every day. We work in changing, ambiguous environments, so we embrace nuance, inclusivity, and complexity to deliver programs that work for the diverse groups of individuals who rely on us.   Who You Are:   You have a proven track record using data-driven solutions to improve social outcomes - and bring a multidisciplinary approach to doing so.  You apply variety of skills: whether thinking strategically about how to develop an enduring process, digging deep into a complex data analysis, or putting yourself in the shoes of an end-user to answer a question they didn’t know they had - you’re comfortable thinking from a number of different perspectives  You are able to anticipate questions from your stakeholders while remaining objective in how you approach their unique challenges. You are experienced deriving value from imperfect data, but also know when to pull the emergency stop button.   We’re not building a team for a day—this is a project for the long haul. More than anything else, we’re looking for people who are excited by our mission, love to create, are honest about what they know, fascinated by what they don’t, and relish the opportunity to work with people who value the same. In this position you will:   Conduct and supervise analysis on data from disparate data sources to distill human-centered operations and processes into meaningful insights or evaluate and improve the effectiveness of large-scale healthcare related directly addressable (email, SMS, autodial, etc) outreach campaigns.  Drive data analysis and data management strategies to create systematic methods of measuring performance across complex systems and technical implementations.  Develop KPIs and metrics that address root problems and develop compelling visualizations to allow clients to easily understand challenges and take a clear action.  Check, clean and transform incoming data for data pipelines, and help others to do the same.  Collaborate with engineers, data scientists, program managers and external stakeholders to troubleshoot problems and proactively create solutions.  Strive to support team excellence by developing high quality documentation.  Work both independently and as part of a team to deliver accurate products on short deadlines.   You probably have:   Advanced understanding of how to manipulate data using SQL or Python.  Significant proficiency in one or more general or statistical programming languages (i.e. Python, Ruby or R) to systematically solve problems, and interest in learning new tools and techniques.  Significant experience creating repeatable data transformation processes.  Experience going from insight to impact: using the results of your analysis to tell a story through visualization, presentation, and writing.  3-4+ years of work experience working with structured/unstructured data.   You may also have experience:   Leading a project in which you (and possibly also your team) led a client from the point of analysis to change in behavior - whether internal or external to the organization.  Helping more junior analysts take their work from 80% to done: maybe by quality checking results, adding context, or helping to organize raw analysis into stories and recommendations.  Experience developing solutions that blend data-driven decision-making with thoughtful understanding of human-centered design/processes.  Authoring narrative and data visualizations that were tailored to engage your client at the right level of detail.  Guiding significant aspects of larger projects that aim to achieve key objectives, using your strong understanding of the organization’s end goal and with minimal direct supervision.  An undergraduate degree in a quantitative field or equivalent technical training. Conducting writing, testing, and implementing algorithmic modeling or machine learning work product to inform strategic decision-making for a client or organization.   This position requires that you successfully attain and maintain a Federal Public Trust background investigation that our government clients require.

WFIRST, conceived as a filled aperture, wide field, near infrared flagship-class observatory, was proposed to settle fundamental questions about the nature of dark energy and to complete the census of all possible types of exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy using wide-field imaging onto a very large, dense detector array. To accomplish this, the mission will accumulate 256 trillion pixel images at a rate of one every 15 minutes for analysis.  The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in early Spring of 2019, is conducting wide-field imaging of nearly the entire celestial sphere in search of exoplanets that eclipse their host star. Tiling the sky over a period of 2 years using four large detector arrays, TESS will recover about 2.5 million photometric lightcurves for each of its 26 sectors before moving on to a survey of the Galactic plane. The community, using a crude box-least squares method, is searching this vast trove for the faint signature of exoplanets - simply discarding other sources of stellar variability as noise.  These two missions and others under consideration have one thing in common – very large, very complex data sets replete with observatory systematics and elusive, tenuous astrophysical signals. Recognizing the significant challenge this raises for the science return of TESS, WFIRST and future survey missions, NASA seeks a post doctoral fellow with the necessary data science skills to formulate a systematic approach to extraction of science in the face of extremely high data rates or in large complex archives.  Examples of areas of interest include:  Machine learning for classification of astrophysical signals Artificial intelligence augmentation of spaceborne observatories to reduce data transmission rates Migration of science processing to cloud-based computing Development of highly accessible data bases with in situ computing Graphics Processing Unit acceleration of scientific data processing  Candidates need not have a strong background in astronomy or physics to apply.

These hyper-spectral measurements enable retrievals of atmospheric trace gasses like ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, formaldehyde, and aerosols. Suomi NPP OMPS, launched in 2011, comprises of three complementary sensors - Limb Profiler (LP), Nadir Profiler (NP) and Nadir Mapper (NM) - that scan the same region of the atmosphere from Earth's surface to the mesosphere within minutes enabling retrievals of total columns and vertical ozone profiles. NOAA-20 (formally JPSS-1) OMPS, launched in 2017, includes only the two nadir sensors, but future JPSS missions 2, 3, and 4 will include all three sensors, including the Limb Profiler. Observations with a series of OMPS instruments will be extended to mid-century.  Large amounts of acquired data from hyper-spectral sensors like OMPS require new approaches for data analysis, calibrations, and inverse modelling. This opportunity is for candidates interested in applying the Machine Learning framework to analyze and interpretate OMPS spectral measurements, which can lead to improvements in the instrument calibration and ozone retrieval algorithm. If successful, this technique can be later applied to exploit the synergy of the OMPS sensors to effectively combine measurements from limb and nadir sensors for developing new retrieval algorithms.  A successful candidate should have a degree in one of the following STEM fields Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or Meteorology, and have advanced programming skills working with big data (e.g. Python). Location: Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland   Field of Science: Earth Science   Advisors: Natalya Kramarova natalya.a.kramarova@nasa.gov  614-5115 Eligibility is currently open to:   U.S. Citizens;  U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents;  Foreign nationals who are in the U.S. at the time of application and on a valid J1 visa; and,  Foreign nationals, asylees or refugees in the U.S. at the time of application with a valid EAD card and pending I-485 or I-589 forms.

About Us  VIDEO  Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.  You  As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.  The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""  Us  The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.  Your Day  While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:   Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.  Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.  Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.  Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.  Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.   Required Skills / Experiences   Clear and empathetic communicator . You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.  Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods . These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.  Strong programming skills . Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.  Strong exploratory data analysis skills . Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.  Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset.  We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.  At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field . This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged. This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.   Desired Skills / Experiences   2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).  Experience with relational databases.  Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.  You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.  Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.   Pivotal is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that will consider all qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity or expression, national origin, genetics, age, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.",30+ days ago,34 reviews

Be an active contributor to FAS Data Evidence Governance Board activities. . Use algorithms to drive outcomes removing unconscious bias and protecting data ethically. About The Role and Project All of the Federal Marketplace (FMP) and Digital Experience (DX) initiatives require extensive data management, analysis and normalization. FAS has made great strides in the past two years by bringing key data into a FAS Enterprise Data Architecture (EDA) with a data set catalog. In order to bring data into the EDA, data scientists/analysts need to normalize data across multiple systems and sync up data fields to ensure the EDA holds clean, authoritative data that can be used by all of FAS. A good amount of FAS’s data is still held on 30 year old legacy production systems. Often, these data sources do not have similar data elements or the field names are not clear for data consumers. More current data sources such as “prices paid” data are reported in inconsistent formats and are in need of data standards. In order to create unified digital tools for FAS schedule customers, disparate data sources must be painstakingly combined into a unified data structure. Existing data science capabilities within GSA are at or over capacity with demand from across the enterprise. The outcomes of this process will: Increase data quality Enhances data integrity for the Digital Experience (DX) project Provide faster delivery of quality data to customers in support of unpriced services Support TDR expansion and improve the useability and usage of TDR data The Fine Print: Expected travel 0-10%; may increase based on business needs This is an exempt, full-time position Censeo offers a competitive compensation and benefits package, including paid vacation and sick leave, flexible and remote work opportunities, and tuition and training reimbursement.

As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems. Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed and would love to share it with you. Our process can be a little bit different from some other companies; we tend to hire data scientists slowly, after we have gotten to know people a little bit, and this job posting is the mechanism for initiating that process. Most of our recent hires were the product of ongoing conversations that resulted in a formal fit when the timing was right for both of us. This does mean we sometimes miss out on potential hires, but we believe there are a lot of good people out there; we are willing to wait not only for the right person, but also for the right timing. It has been a successful recipe so far. . Requirements: What you bring to the table: Now on to the fun of formal requirements-we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. You will need: A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field. For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 3 years of experience managing teams. For mid/senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on data science projects. A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance. A bit more informally, though, you should have experience with Python, R, Hadoop, Spark, Random Forests, Deterministic Forests (jk), Jupyter Notebooks, xkcd, Deep Learning, and a host of other tools and techniques: you do not need to know them all, but you should be comfortable and capable with quite a few of them. You might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host, but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues. Why Red Alpha? A few of our perks and benefits: You can retire sooner rather than planned:  Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions. You can have a career AND a life:  Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (up to 25 days of personal time off) and 10 paid holidays.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=4332f36b772aa96f&from=web&vjs=3,30,Junior data scientist / bioinformatics,Data Tecnica,"Glen Echo, MD 20812","Data Tecnica Int’l + NIH/NINDS Open as of February 1st, 2021. Come join our collaborative team at Data Tecnica International (DTI) by supporting two great labs at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Stroke (NINDS, Ward and Levine labs). This opportunity focuses on aiding with data processing, management and analysis of dynamic cellular data in the contexts of both cellular and animal models. The minimal qualifications of the candidate is a US citizen (or work permit holder) with some experience in bioinformatics, high performance computing, python programming and a basic knowledge of genomics. Ideally, a master’s degree in bioinformatics, neural computation, computational biology or biomedical data science would be best. This position is open immediately. This position is remote for the duration of at least one year, commensurate with ~1300 hours of work estimated for the calendar year. Please see below for a comprehensive outline of potential duties, responsibilities and background on the collaborative labs. If interested, please send: CV, recommendation contact information and a GitHub link or other code example to info@datatecnica.com. Levine Lab Data Types : All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form. Mouse behavior Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc. Cellular activity (post-hoc): Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers Cellular activity (dynamic): Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the broader population of recorded cells Levine Lab Analysis Goals : Data analysis: Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar) Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position) Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions Recording from different populations of neurons Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types Different behavioral/motivational contexts Developmental age Spinal cord injury Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration Data Modeling: Physical forces/torques/biomechanics Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys) Dynamical systems modeling Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration Levine Lab SOW : Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing. The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative. Levine Lab Background : The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury. To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery. Ward Lab Data Types : Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint Ward Lab Analysis Goals : Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets. Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets) Ward Lab SOW Data analysis (as above) The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI) Ward Lab   Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI: Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible. Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions. Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI. Ward Lab background : The Ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We exclusively use genetically-modified human iPSCs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. iPSCs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. Almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.",30+ days ago,
