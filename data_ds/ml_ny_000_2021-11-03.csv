https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=f308c5ec3264a3d4&from=web&vjs=3,640,Algo Software Engineer - On Campus Recruiting,Hudson River Trading,"New York, NY 10005","At HRT, we program computers to intelligently trade on the stock market. We make the world's markets more financially efficient using smart algorithms. To get the job done, we hire some of the smartest computer scientists in the world to develop both our low latency trading platform and our massive distributed research platform. Algo Software Engineers (AE) are programmers that are embedded in HRT's trading teams and work hand-in-hand with Algo Strategy Developers (AD). Whereas ADs tend to use their math skills to make smarter strategies, AEs focus on the software that powers trading and research. Because of this close collaboration, AEs tend to be the type of engineers that thrive on constant interaction and discussion. Hearing how their most recently deployed system allowed for whole new types of research would make their week. AEs are the type of engineers that don't mind juggling a few projects at once and have a varied portfolio of project types, from long-term ambitious new systems to fire-fighting live issues.  Our environment is particularly well suited to driven, self-motivated programmers. For one, the company's Partners are all programmers. Team Leads spend a majority of their time doing technical work. Algo teams run on a very bottom-up approach that encourages everyone on the teams to come up with ideas and dictate the direction of each team together. Finally, there is very little emphasis placed on project management process (almost no meetings and no project managers) and there is a lot of emphasis placed on engineering process such as automated testing, design/code reviews, and technical training. We are a Linux/Unix shop with a codebase written primarily in C++ and Python. If you are not a C++ or Python or Linux expert, that's probably OK. We really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. That being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as C++ or Java. Here are a few examples of programmers who are currently AEs at HRT:   When he's not solving riddles and dancing salsa, David's writing distributed computing APIs. He regularly solves bugs like ""one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on Tuesdays"". He likes bridging the gap between Algo Strategy Developers and Systems Engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. He really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.  Before joining HRT, Jessie worked in big tech for 6 years, doing primarily web development. She enjoys taking unclear problems (""This job takes too long to run."") and figuring out the right way to solve them (""The reason the speed of this job is concerning is because it's impractically slow to debug. We need more interactive debugging tools to avoid constantly restarting jobs.""). She cares about writing reliable and thoroughly tested software. When she's not coding, Jessie enjoys solo traveling (she's been to every continent except Antarctica!), reading far too many books, and speaking at conferences.  Aaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to HRT. He cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. He gets joy from his teammates' happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable. He's gotten coworkers from other teams involved in latency improvements to his group's live trading. He enjoys the collaborative environment and learning from his coworkers.  Culture  Hudson River Trading (HRT) brings a scientific approach to trading financial products. We have built one of the world's most sophisticated computing environments for research and development. Our researchers are at the forefront of innovation in the world of algorithmic trading.  At HRT we come from a variety of disciplines: mathematics and computer science, physics, and engineering, media and tech. We're a community of self-starters who are motivated by the excitement of being at the cutting edge of automation in every part of our organization - from trading, to business operations, to recruiting and beyond. Our culture celebrates great ideas whether they come from HRT veterans or new hires. At HRT we're friends and colleagues – whether we are sharing a meal, playing the latest board game, or writing elegant code. We embrace a culture of togetherness that extends far beyond the walls of our office.  Feel like you belong at HRT? Our goal is to find the best people and bring them together to do great work in a place where everyone is valued. HRT is proud of our diverse staff; we have offices all over the globe and benefit from our varied and unique perspectives. HRT is an equal opportunity employer; so whoever you are we'd love to get to know you.",30+ days ago,

We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges.

What We Care About: What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job. Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.

We believe that businesses only succeed by using their time intentionally. Our products support our customers through time tracking, reporting, and forecasting features.  Harvest started in 2006 as a team of three and has grown to today’s current team of almost 70 with Harvesters working from around the globe. We’ve worked as a remote team since the beginning and we continue to hire the right people for the job no matter where they call home.  We strive to create a workplace culture where everyone feels valued, included, and heard. One important aspect of this is continuing to create spaces for diverse life experiences and work histories. If you are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented and disadvantaged in tech, business, and society in general, we want to meet you and we encourage you to apply. Harvest Engineering At Harvest, you’ll be working with a team of honest and respectful engineers who value giving and receiving feedback and trust that they can count on each other. The Harvest Engineering Department consists of four divisions: Software Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering, Data & Security Engineering, and Quality Engineering. Our Security team works with all the Engineering departments to keep our web, mobile, and desktop applications safe and secure while helping the rest of the company to maintain a secure work environment. Why We’re Hiring Security at Harvest previously existed as a shared responsibility between different teams at Harvest. We are now taking an important step to create a dedicated Security team within the Engineering organization. The Security Engineer would be a founding member of this brand new team at Harvest. As a Security Engineer at Harvest, you’ll be working to improve our security stance in all areas. Here are some real examples of the work we’ve done lately that might help you get a better idea of what this job entails:  Develop alerts to keep tabs on suspicious activity in our applications.  Monitor external credential breaches and force a password reset for users that could be affected.  Automate our security audits on work machines.  Deal with spam, credential stuffing, and fraud attempts.  Field a security researcher’s reports of security issues, from validation to fix and bounty award.  Improve our external and internal security documentation.  Requirements What You’ll Do   Contribute to the development of security tooling, security policy, and product security.  Help manage our public bug bounty program: triaging, fixing and coordinating with affected teams to address valid findings.  Work side-by-side with cross-functional development teams, bring awareness of secure coding practices, and teach developers application security fundamentals. Dive into spam, fraud, and other security related investigations, combing through large volumes of logs to identify anomalies or patterns, and develop protections based on them.

You believe feedback is a gift, seek it out, and act on it.  What You’ve Done  You know what makes browsers, web, and native applications secure and have knowledge of common security vulnerabilities and mitigations.  You've written robust and reliable production code in a modern language or framework such as JavaScript, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or have a strong interest in learning these technologies.

The project’s goal is to learn unified high-dimensional distributed representations of patients using healthcare data from multiple modalities, including medical imaging, electronic health records (EHRs), and wearable sensors, among others. Furthermore, the projects will also involve exploring ways to leverage longitudinal (temporal) patient data to learn such representations.  The postdocs will work with Prof. Sumit Chopra and Prof. Daniel Sodickson. Learning accurate and useful patient representations will require working at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and physics-based modeling. There are many scenarios under which such representations can be learned, including using unimodal/multimodal and static/dynamic (temporal) datasets. Despite the enormous promise of machine learning applications in healthcare, the deployment of machine learning models in real clinical settings has remained elusive. The projects will also focus on exploring ways to utilize representations to derive real clinical benefits, such as improving diagnostic accuracy, speeding up image acquisition, and proposing personalized treatment plans.  Through this position, you will be a part of (and working at the intersection of) two of the most sought-after schools in their respective fields, namely the Courant Institute (a leader in applied mathematics and machine learning) and the Grossman School of Medicine (a leader in healthcare research and delivery). This opportunity will also allow you to readily deploy your research in a clinical setting within the hospital, thereby enabling you to make a real-world impact, saving and/or improving the lives of real people.  The positions are available immediately. They are full-time appointments for one year, with the possibility of renewal for up to three years.
