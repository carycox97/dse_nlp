About the team  At Roku, the Data Science team lives and works on a kind of frontier: We get called in for things that haven't been done before. This requires meaningful collaboration with the platform team, the firmware team and even the finance team to prove or disprove new product ideas. Often the idea evolves from what was first proposed until it is a wholly new thing that gets shipped. No one here is ashamed to present their latest work, and you'll find yourself pitching ideas to others in the company, including to executives.  Beyond collaboration, we seek builders with the persistence to keep pushing. Because we spend our time making prototypes and testing brand new ideas on systems with a lot of moving parts, we are faced with failures every day. The only way to really make something work is to really dig into the reasons and understand why. We value the grit and persistence it takes to keep just trying.  About the role  Roku pioneered TV streaming and continues to innovate and lead the industry. The Roku Channel has us well-positioned to help shape the future of streaming. Continued success relies on investing in Data Science and diving deep into the economics of our business.  This role is right for you if you value impact. You will be researching and solving complex AI problems and then working closely with Machine Learning engineers to automate this process to prove it out at scale. You will influence the direction of Roku's strategic goals, question the inherent assumptions in our thinking, and define business objectives in an innovative and encouraging environment.  The ideal candidate will have endless curiosity and can pair a global mindset with locally relevant execution. You should be a gritty problem solver and self-starter who can drive programs with the product teams within Roku and across external strategic partner organizations. The successful candidate will display a balance of hard and soft skills, including the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.  What you'll be doing  Research and develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms to improve user experience on Roku's platform.  Develop economic models (e.g., market design, pricing, program evaluation, and forecasting) to better understand the user experience on Roku's platform.  Run live experiments to prototype the improvements and prove their efficacy.  Assist the ML engineering teams with productization of successful algorithms, ensuring your work continues to drive value at scale.  Provide expert consultative assistance on AI to other teams in the company, including research data scientists working in other areas of Roku's stack, and provide technical feedback on their econometric work.  Contribute to the technical vision of the Research Data Science team.  We're excited if you have  PhD Degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Operations Research, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, or similar quantitative field with a solid understanding of ML.  Experience in causal Machine Learning and experimentation.  Proven problem solving and analytical abilities with solid software development skills in Python and SQL.  Experience in creating and integrating AI solutions with a smaller resource footprint at the hardware level.  Experience with TB or PB size datasets and Spark preferred.  Nice-to-have's include knowledge of user behavior in subscription and advertising-based video, auctions and/or advertising.  The Roku culture  Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.  We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

The NEFSC Protected Species Branch (PSB) mission includes evaluating threats to species and populations due to anthropogenic activities. The Machine Learning Image Recognition Analyst will be working on protected species bycatch, which is when protected animals get caught or entangled in fishing gear. Bycatch can negatively affect species such as dolphins, sea turtles, protected fish, and whales by harming animals, contributing to population declines, and impeding population recovery. For this project, video data that was collected on commercial fishing vessels as part of a fisheries monitoring program is being reviewed so that bycatch events and species can be identified and further analyzed. Since such interactions are relatively rare events, these data are sparse and an automated review of the video can be a realistic and cost effective way to identify actual or probable protected species interactions. The Machine Learning Image Recognition Analyst will develop analyses of image data to inform bycatch estimates and assessments of fisheries impacts on protected species. The Analyst’s ultimate goal is to develop an algorithm automating the detection and identification of protected species visualized on video from gillnet, bottom trawl, and other types of fishing gear. The Machine Learning Image Recognition Analyst will begin by curating and developing a protected species (bird, mammal, turtle) image library utilizing video and still image data sets. After that, the Analyst will explore approaches to automating image analysis, developing algorithms in support of machine learning applications and annotated training data sets. Duties Gaining familiarity with the data and processes, including image review, data analysis, image data set curation, preparing and processing data. Identifying, acquiring and/or generating, and characterizing data and annotations. Investigating and determining suitable machine learning technologies and available open-source resources (software applications, coding, and curated datasets) for a data-sparse context. Training and testing models. Developing machine learning based video analysis; creating a system and workflow for conducting the automated image analysis. Generating reports that use the image data to inform assessments of fisheries impacts on protected species. Qualifications and Skills BS in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, or a closely related field. Deep proficiency in at least one programming language relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence for image recognition (VIAME, TensorFlow, Python, R, Matlab, C++, etc.) Demonstrated skill and knowledge in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to image data for image recognition. Experience in photogrammetry and information extraction using machine learning, deep neural nets for image recognition. Project development and management skills are desirable. Statistical programming skills are desirable. Coursework and/or exposure to biological data is desired, but not required. The skills needed are in programming, not biology. US citizenship and presence. Ability to comply with EO 14042. Excellent written and oral communication skills. Track record of success in working remotely. Demonstrated ability to contribute timely deliverables and work collaboratively as part of a team. The position is expected to be full-time for one year, the rate of pay depends on skills and experience, and the position is eligible for the benefits described on the Integrated Statistics website. The position will probably start remotely but with the goal of intermittent in-person work at the NEFSC lab in Woods Hole, MA.
