(https://talltimbers.org/) is recruiting a full-time Post-Doctoral Research Scientist to assess uncertainties in burned area and derived data used to inform conservation and land management decision making, supporting the Southeast FireMap project (SE FireMap), an online tool designed to inform conservation and land management decision making. At the heart of SE FireMap is a fire mapping and reporting tool for the southeastern U.S. that enables resource managers to improve their regional or local approaches to managing wildfire risk/management in urban and rural communities. SE FireMap integrates state burn permit requests and geospatial layers representing vegetation and habitat types with the Landsat Burned Area products to track both prescribed fire and wildfires, mapping all detectable fires (down to 5 acres) across nine states in the southeastern US. Users can visualize and analyze these data layers in model-based prioritization tools and decision support tools through the SE FireMap interface. SE FireMap is currently in a beta development phase with the plans to expand the visualization and analysis capabilities of the tool. Behind SE FireMap is a rich collaborative effort between NRCS, USGS, and Tall Timbers with extensive stakeholder engagement.   The selected candidate will work with existing data products and independent validation data to assess how errors in the data products vary seasonally and across biophysical gradients using statistical or machine learning models. Results of these analyses may include predictive maps that help SE FireMap end users visualize and better understand uncertainties in the data products and how those uncertainties propagate through the reporting and decision support tools. The selected candidate will be expected to collaborate closely with SE FireMap co-PIs, Joe Noble (Tall Timbers), Todd Hawbaker and Melanie Vanderhoof (USGS), to develop and lead uncertainty analyses, present findings at workshops and conferences, and publish findings in peer-reviewed journal articles.   Position Responsibilities       Apply GIS and remote sensing principles and methods to analyze data and solve geospatial problems for projects involving natural resources.    Analyze image data primarily acquired from Landsat, using statistical analysis software, image analysis software, or Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcGIS, ERDAS, ENVI, Python, and     R to evaluate and analyze data obtained from remote sensing systems.      Quantify uncertainties in remotely sensed data products and build models to assess and understand their spatial patterns.    Participate in stakeholder engagement workshops and outreach sessions.    Present research results at virtual and in-person scientific meetings and conferences.    Lead writing of technical reports and peer-reviewed journal articles resulting from research and analyses..     Desired Training and Experience      PhD in remote sensing, geospatial science, GIS or physical science or similar with specific coursework or relevant work experience in remote sensing, image processing, statistics or data science, GIS, geography, or ecology. A PhD is not required to apply but must be awarded prior to the starting date for this position.    Professional knowledge of the theories, principles, concepts, practices, standards, and methods of geography and natural resources to assume duties related to the analysis of relationships between various natural resources, and apply established geospatial analysis processes, protocols, and solutions to support project objectives.    Knowledge of Remote Sensing, Spatial and Biophysical Modeling, Computer Mapping and GIS     Applications for Natural Resources, Statistics and Machine Learning.      Skill in programming languages used for data analysis and processing (e.g., Python, R)    Experience planning and managing geospatial research projects.    Strong organizational, data management, and communication skills.    Demonstrated success publishing research results in peer-reviewed literature.    Ability to work across multiple technology disciplines in a collaborative team.    Desire to continue learning in the fields of remote sensing, spatial analysis, and conservation science.     The selected applicant will be employed by Tall Timbers and based out of Tall Timbers, Tallahassee, FL with the option for remote work. This position will report to Joe Noble, GIS/Information Technology Program Director and work in close collaboration with Todd Hawbaker and Melanie Vanderhoof (USGS).
