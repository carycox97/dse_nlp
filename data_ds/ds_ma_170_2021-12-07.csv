Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.   From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the team  At Roku, the Data Science team lives and works on a kind of frontier: We get called in for things that haven't been done before. This requires meaningful collaboration with the platform team, the firmware team and even the finance team to prove or disprove new product ideas. Often the idea evolves from what was first proposed until it is a wholly new thing that gets shipped. No one here is ashamed to present their latest work, and you'll find yourself pitching ideas to others in the company, including to executives.   Beyond collaboration, we seek builders with the persistence to keep pushing. Because we spend our time making prototypes and testing brand new ideas on systems with a lot of moving parts, we are faced with failures every day. The only way to really make something work is to really dig into the reasons and understand why. We value the grit and persistence it takes to keep just trying.  About the role  Roku pioneered TV streaming and continues to innovate and lead the industry. The Roku Channel has us well-positioned to help shape the future of streaming. Continued success relies on investing in Data Science and diving deep into the economics of our business.   This role is right for you if you enjoy diving into messy data, cleaning it up, finding powerful insights, presenting them in a compelling way, developing models and then working closely with software engineers to automate this process, to prove it out at scale. You should also relish the ability to influence the direction of the team's strategic goals, question the inherent assumptions in our thinking, and defining the business objectives in an innovative and encouraging environment.   The ideal candidate will have endless curiosity and can pair a global mindset with locally relevant execution. You should be a gritty problem solver and self-starter who can drive programs with the product and commercial teams within Roku and across external strategic partner organizations. The successful candidate will display a balance of hard and soft skills, including the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.  What you'll be doing  Develop data science algorithms to improve user experience on Roku's platform.  Develop economic models (e.g., market design, pricing, program evaluation, and forecasting) to better understand the user experience on Roku's platform.  Run live experiments to prototype the improvements and prove their efficacy.  Dive into data, clean it up, and pull-out insights that can be used to improve system performance and present to senior leaders with recommendations on business actions.  Assist the development team with productization of successful algorithms, ensuring your work continues to drive value at scale.  Provide expert consultative assistance to other teams in the company, including data scientists working in other areas of Roku's stack and provide technical feedback on their econometric work.  Contribute to the technical vision of the Data Science team.  We're excited if you have  PhD Degree  6 yrs + of experience post PhD in Machine Learning, Operations Research, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, or similar quantitative field.  Experience in causal Machine Learning and experimentation.  Proven problem solving and analytical abilities.  Software development skills in Python, Java, Julia or Scala.  Proficiency with analysis tools such as Spark, R, MATLAB or similar.  Experience with TB or PB size datasets preferred.  Nice-to-have's include knowledge of user behavior in subscription and advertising-based video, auctions and/or advertising.  The Roku culture  Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.   We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

You have extensive experience working with time series data, preferably with healthcare biosignal data (e.g. EKG, actigraphy, EEG, Polysomnography, etc.).  You're comfortable building tools and overseeing experiments that uniquely leverage data from our clinical partners, public datasets, and our own sensors to aid clinical decisions.  You realize that lowering hypothesis test turnaround time from months to minutes requires applying best-of-breed DevOps concepts to the machine learning workflow.  You've leveraged cloud infrastructure to train models on inconveniently large datasets.  You're painfully aware that thoughtful data curation is a prerequisite to analysis results that hold up under practical application.  You make use of best-of-breed experiment tracking systems to ensure that model performance is reproducible, observable, and debuggable.  You can't wait to combine your background with our unprecedented EEG dataset to blow published statistical EEG results out of the water.  You've developed a solid, heavily-exercised workflow for debugging model performance; you now know more about the limitations of automatic differentiation and distributed heterogeneous computing than you ever thought you would when you started your ML journey (e.g. ""How can I alter this model's architecture to mitigate the decrease in sample throughput once I lower the minibatch size?"").  You can ensure that we properly select and rigorously measure the quantities we're optimizing for, both in our research and in our business.  You enjoy working in teams and providing/receiving regular feedback to improve technical and operational practices.  You have excellent speaking, listening and writing skills.  You're excited to work in an environment that makes heavy use of Julia, Docker/K8s, workflow orchestration tools (e.g. Argo, Airflow), SQL, and GraphQL.

We’re a growing pharmaceutical company that is breaking through in neurology and oncology, with a strong emphasis on research and development. Our history includes the development of many innovative medicines, notably the discovery of the world's most widely-used treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. As we continue to expand, we are seeking highly-motivated individuals who want to work in a fast-paced environment and make a difference. If this is your profile, we want to hear from you. General Summary: Eisai has been dedicated for decades to the pursuit of novel therapeutics to improve the lives of people suffering from dementia and their families. Recognizing the potential for human genetics, data sciences and precision chemistry to disrupt the drug discovery paradigm, Eisai launched the Eisai Center for Genetics Guided Dementia Discovery (G2D2) in 2019 to accelerate the discovery of innovative therapeutics. G2D2 is a unique drug discovery organization driven by a diverse group of passionate, dedicated and collaborative scientists committed to one goal: delivering breakthroughs for patients and their families. All Eisai employees, as part of the company’s human health care (hhc) mission, spend at least 1% of their working time with patients and families to ensure that the innovation we drive is based on an understanding of their real needs. The predominant research focus at G2D2, driven by insights from human genetics, is immunodementia: targeting immune-related targets for dementia. At G2D2, we focus not only on how human genetics and other human biology data may identify and validate therapeutic targets with increased likelihood of success in clinical trials, but also how this data guides selection of the best approaches to design new therapeutics and the selection of strategies to deliver these therapeutics to the right patient at the right time. Recognizing the obvious alignment between human genetics and nucleic acid modalities, our precision chemistry strategy is to directly validate human biology hypotheses by utilizing our unique RNA targeting therapeutic platform. G2D2’s expertise in harnessing molecular complexity (stereochemistry and topology) to successfully discover and develop natural product based therapeutics has been applied to create an evolving unique nucleic acid immunotherapeutic platform that is being employed globally in multiple clinical and pre-clinical programs at Eisai. G2D2’s cutting-edge 50,000-square-foot facility is strategically located in Cambridge, MA, to accelerate collaborations with leading research institutes in this world-class biotech hub. Our facility has been designed around an open-lab concept, enabling scientists with multi-disciplinary backgrounds to work together in a single integrated lab space. Our labs include state-of-the-art capabilities that support the variety of disciplines located at the site, including medicinal and process chemistry, in-vitro and in-vivo biology, microscopy, DMPK, drug safety, chemical and structural biology, automation and screening, and more. G2D2 is home to Eisai’s global capabilities in neurology discovery data science. G2D2 is also home to other global Eisai functions, including global health, DMPK, Safety, IP, oncology, thus providing a rich environment for cross-functional interaction. Our office is designed to foster an atmosphere of mission-driven and collaborative science, using new collaboration tools and technologies, and is being optimized to support a hybrid work environment. At Eisai, we highly value both internal and external collaboration and pursue flexible research models with a range of external scientific partners to accelerate delivery of innovative medicines. To this end, the G2D2 facility includes the Eisai Innovation Center Biolabs, which provides space and infrastructure to start-up/spin-out companies conducting high-risk but potentially transformative research that can impact the discovery of breakthrough neuroscience therapeutics. More information about G2D2 is provided here: ( http://eisai.mediaroom.com/2018-06-12-Eisai-Inc-to-Launch-Center-for-Genetics-Guided-Dementia-Discovery-in-Cambridge-Massachusetts ) and here ( https://us.eisai.com/research/g2d2 ), and about Eisai's Neurology strategy and pipeline are provided here ( https://www.eisai.com/index.html ).
