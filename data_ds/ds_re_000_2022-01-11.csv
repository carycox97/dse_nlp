We are the de-facto technology standard for modeling and predicting consumer perception and preference related to food, beverage, and other consumer products. Our unique AI quantifies subjective data and predicts what many believe to be impossible: the individual taste preferences of over 3 billion consumer groups worldwide, today and in the future. While AFS has 10+ years of sensory data, the database fits in memory and does not require ""big data"" techniques. Instead of large amounts of low dimensional data, we have a small amount of very high value high dimensional data. Working with such a data set gives the team a strong preference for mathematically elegant and thoughtful models - we care more about a deep understanding of the underlying statistics than the possibilities of deep neural networks.   About the Role Our capabilities are evolving as we automate our prediction and reporting workflow on a new data platform. We are looking for experienced Data Scientists to join the team responsible for all data applications, including model building, model testing, benchmarking, data visualization, and model performance. AFS empowers the data science team to own all phases of the model development process. We look for data scientists who are excited by the challenge of solving problems using a wide array of modeling and quantitative techniques. Requirements What You'll Do Develop new models for new predictive capabilities.  Test, train, update, or re-architect existing models with new data and research. Develop new interactive data visualizations for the customer reporting platform. Push the boundaries on sensory data applications by expanding our technological reach into new areas. Work with the data engineering and application engineering team to understand client requirements and translate requirements to model capabilities. Build reusable code and develop technical documents to represent new features.  Less common areas of work may include: Time-sensitive development of new models to rapidly test capabilities requested by a customer - while AFS does not build custom technology for any one customer, we will prioritize and align our product roadmap based on customer demand. Monitor mission-critical real-time analysis for product development cycles. Write technical white papers for presentation at research conferences (in collaboration with the AFS R&D team or R&D teams at other companies). Write technical blog posts to promote new features and capabilities.   What We Are Looking For Masters, Ph.D., or equivalent (including projects in cryptography, quantum computing, or work for the “census bureau”) in a quantitative field such as Physics, Genomics/Computational Biology, Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Engineering, or Econometrics. Experience with complex data flows or model chains with multiple pathways from intermediary states. Superior verbal and written communication skills with the ability to effectively advocate technical solutions to scientists, engineering teams, and business audiences. Natural curiosity and desire to learn. Fluency in a scripting or computing language (e.g. R, Python, Scala, etc.) is required, though we’re language-agnostic for prior experience. Demonstrable track record of dealing well with ambiguity, prioritizing needs, and delivering results in a dynamic environment. Experience with Postgres for database, AWS for cloud resource, R for model building, Kubernetes, Clojure, Datomic, Terraform.  How We Work We're a New York-based distributed workforce. Our mission is to create a better-tasting world. Our decision-making is shaped by discovering and solving market and user problems, not by the corner office or ""smartest people in the room."" We value and prioritize transparent communication, believe that good ideas can (and do) come from anywhere, so we encourage Analytical Flavor Systems team members to work together across positions and roles. We are currently fully remote but working out of our New York office as necessary, and situations permit. If you have a passion for rolling up your sleeves, building new programs, and have a solid team-player mentality, we'd love to hear from you!   Diversity & Inclusion at Analytical Flavor Systems We're serious about growing diversity in the tech industry. We purposely built Analytical Flavor Systems to be a company where people love their work and show respect and empathy to their colleagues. Diversity typically includes but is not limited to differences in race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, political and religious affiliation, socioeconomic background, cultural background, geographic location, disabilities and abilities, relationship status, veteran status, and age. To work on diversity means that we welcome these differences and strive to increase the visibility of traditionally underrepresented groups. It also means that Analytical Flavor Systems employs a zero-tolerance policy for employees who exhibit behavior contrary to these principles.

The NEFSC Protected Species Branch (PSB) mission includes evaluating threats to species and populations due to anthropogenic activities. The Machine Learning Image Recognition Analyst will be working on protected species bycatch, which is when protected animals get caught or entangled in fishing gear. Bycatch can negatively affect species such as dolphins, sea turtles, protected fish, and whales by harming animals, contributing to population declines, and impeding population recovery. For this project, video data that was collected on commercial fishing vessels as part of a fisheries monitoring program is being reviewed so that bycatch events and species can be identified and further analyzed. Since such interactions are relatively rare events, these data are sparse and an automated review of the video can be a realistic and cost effective way to identify actual or probable protected species interactions. The Machine Learning Image Recognition Analyst will develop analyses of image data to inform bycatch estimates and assessments of fisheries impacts on protected species. The Analyst’s ultimate goal is to develop an algorithm automating the detection and identification of protected species visualized on video from gillnet, bottom trawl, and other types of fishing gear. The Machine Learning Image Recognition Analyst will begin by curating and developing a protected species (bird, mammal, turtle) image library utilizing video and still image data sets. After that, the Analyst will explore approaches to automating image analysis, developing algorithms in support of machine learning applications and annotated training data sets. Duties Gaining familiarity with the data and processes, including image review, data analysis, image data set curation, preparing and processing data. Identifying, acquiring and/or generating, and characterizing data and annotations. Investigating and determining suitable machine learning technologies and available open-source resources (software applications, coding, and curated datasets) for a data-sparse context. Training and testing models. Developing machine learning based video analysis; creating a system and workflow for conducting the automated image analysis. Generating reports that use the image data to inform assessments of fisheries impacts on protected species. Qualifications and Skills BS in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, or a closely related field. Deep proficiency in at least one programming language relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence for image recognition (VIAME, TensorFlow, Python, R, Matlab, C++, etc.) Demonstrated skill and knowledge in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to image data for image recognition. Experience in photogrammetry and information extraction using machine learning, deep neural nets for image recognition. Project development and management skills are desirable. Statistical programming skills are desirable. Coursework and/or exposure to biological data is desired, but not required. The skills needed are in programming, not biology.

In the interest of transparency, here is how we think about the nuances of titles with regard to this role:   Analytics Engineer: this best captures a need for technical rigor; however, it may not clearly stress the importance of finding someone with a very strong business sense.  Data Analyst: this is perhaps the most “accurate,” but it may not articulate the technical requirements; we also fear there may be a stigma against this title as “data scientist” may appeal to more people.

We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore, we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud. We stop them. We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. DS@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception. The human we need for this role will work on  BotGuard : our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.  What you will do: Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product. Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work. Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you. Who you are: You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!). You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles.
