https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=771e98e4afeeb6ff&from=web&vjs=3,510,Senior Data Scientist,Span.IO,"San Francisco, CA","The Mission  The electrical grid was built to carry electricity unidirectionally from central fossil fuel plants to end consumers. As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to re-invent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.  To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make energy decisions. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.  Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.  The Role  We aim to establish the Span panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. Analytics and ML are essential tools to develop features for the smart, green, energy-efficient home of the future. Span's unique ability to monitor and control individual circuits opens up a new avenue for proactive whole-home management and equipment failure detection. As Senior Data Scientist, you will leverage your deep understanding of ML, modeling, and statistics to solve problems including anomaly detection, time series forecasting, and event prediction to optimally manage whole-home energy consumption, deliver meaningful insights to the customer, and notify them about a potential failure of equipment or hazards in their home. You'll be involved through the entire development process, from the acquisition of all additional third-party data, the initial design to remote monitoring in the field.  Responsibilities  Lead the development of ML algorithms from the ground up which includes:  Gain knowledge in the relevant domain (e.g.common failure modes of appliances)  Feature engineering  Prototype new algorithms  Benchmark performance across large scale datasets  Use your experience with different machine learning frameworks to identify suitable tools for integration in Span's software platform  Integrate developed algorithms in our production code base with robust test coverage  Work with the firmware and software teams to design Span's edge model deployment framework; pick which ML framework Span should adopt  Proactively identify opportunities within Span that can benefit from data science analysis  Use fleet data to monitor algorithms in the field   Note: We're a startup, so while this list is broad, it's still just a start; you'll end up wearing many hats during your time at Span.  About You  Required Qualifications  Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, or a closely related field  4+ years of professional experience with developing and implementing machine learning models to production  4+ years of Data Scientist experience  Deep understanding of machine learning algorithms (anomaly/outlier detection in time series data, time series forecasting, clustering algorithms, probabilistic models)  Advanced Python skills, as well as familiarity with pandas and scikit-learn  Software design experience and ability to write clean, maintainable, and shippable production code  Experience working with SQL and data visualization tools  Extensive data modeling and data architecture skills  Knowledge and experience working within cloud computing environments such as AWS  Strong communication and interpersonal skills  Ability to understand and explain complex problems simply and effectively  Bonus Qualifications  Experience optimizing models for resource-constrained edge devices  Experience in data engineering  Domain-specific knowledge either through previous work, courses in college, or side projects  Life at Span  Span is a startup based in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco. We are a small, diverse team of creative thinkers. We value open communication, teamwork, and a make-it-happen attitude - no job is too big or too small. We strive to make a change by imagining what the future could be and building a product to complete that vision. We are looking to grow our team with talented people who are on the same mission to shape the future of energy.  Working at Span, you can expect:   Competitive compensation at a well-funded, venture-backed company  Comprehensive benefits include a choice of medical plans; dental, vision, life, and disability insurance  A sunny, airy office located close to BART and Caltrain public transit  Regular team lunches, brown bag learning opportunities, board games nights, and other opportunities to connect with teammates - in-person and now virtually  Equity grants at a quickly-growing startup  Flexible hours and vacation time - we simultaneously work hard and make space for the important stuff  To be a part of a team and culture that is hard-working has a good sense of humor, values collaboration, and is just a little bit nerdy   Span embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way.
