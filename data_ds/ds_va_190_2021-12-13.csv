Solar energy is one of the fastest-growing industries in the US. Not only is going solar beneficial for the planet; for most Americans it also saves money vs. buying power from the utility. Studies show that the #1 barrier to solar adoption is concern over how to pay for initial installation. The mission of the Financial Products team is to remove that barrier by making it cheap and easy for customers to go solar. This is a “ground floor” opportunity with the opportunity to have an impact at scale almost immediately. The ideal candidate is a true builder. Raising the bar for customer experience in Financial Products is core to SunPower’s strategy, and this role will play a critical role in driving future growth.  Reporting to the EVP of Financial Products, the Director of BI and Data Science, Financial Products will build and lead a team with end-to-end ownership of the data and analytical capabilities that SunPower needs to offer a proprietary suite of world-class financial products. This business serves four main customer types – consumers, dealers, home builders, and fixed-income investors – each with its own unique modeling challenges. The role is responsible for analytics and business intelligence across our loan, lease, and power purchase agreement businesses. As one of the largest and oldest companies in the solar energy business, we have a unique large historical dataset of customer purchasing and payment behavior, as well system performance (IoT data). We also generate large operational datasets every day. This role owns the problem of turning all of this data into a competitive advantage.

You will build and lead a team that can extract, integrate and work on critical data to build out data pipelines, automate reports and dashboards to communicate findings. You know that, ultimately, success in this role requires building self-service tools so that internal customers can do their own analysis; you are not here to run a “data helpdesk.” The ideal candidate has an attitude to continuously innovate and is not satisfied with the status quo.
