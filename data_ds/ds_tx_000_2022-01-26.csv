Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.  From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the team  At Roku, the Data Science team lives and works on a kind of frontier: We get called in for things that haven't been done before. This requires meaningful collaboration with the platform team, the firmware team and even the finance team to prove or disprove new product ideas. Often the idea evolves from what was first proposed until it is a wholly new thing that gets shipped. No one here is ashamed to present their latest work, and you'll find yourself pitching ideas to others in the company, including to executives.  Beyond collaboration, we seek builders with the persistence to keep pushing. Because we spend our time making prototypes and testing brand new ideas on systems with a lot of moving parts, we are faced with failures every day. The only way to really make something work is to really dig into the reasons and understand why. We value the grit and persistence it takes to keep just trying.  About the role  Roku pioneered TV streaming and continues to innovate and lead the industry. The Roku Channel has us well-positioned to help shape the future of streaming. Continued success relies on investing in Data Science and diving deep into the economics of our business.  This role is right for you if you value impact. You will be researching and solving complex AI problems and then working closely with Machine Learning engineers to automate this process to prove it out at scale. You will influence the direction of Roku's strategic goals, question the inherent assumptions in our thinking, and define business objectives in an innovative and encouraging environment.  The ideal candidate will have endless curiosity and can pair a global mindset with locally relevant execution. You should be a gritty problem solver and self-starter who can drive programs with the product teams within Roku and across external strategic partner organizations. The successful candidate will display a balance of hard and soft skills, including the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.  What you'll be doing  Research and develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms to improve user experience on Roku's platform.  Develop economic models (e.g., market design, pricing, program evaluation, and forecasting) to better understand the user experience on Roku's platform.  Run live experiments to prototype the improvements and prove their efficacy.  Assist the ML engineering teams with productization of successful algorithms, ensuring your work continues to drive value at scale.  Provide expert consultative assistance on AI to other teams in the company, including research data scientists working in other areas of Roku's stack, and provide technical feedback on their econometric work.  Contribute to the technical vision of the Research Data Science team.  We're excited if you have  PhD Degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Operations Research, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, or similar quantitative field with a solid understanding of ML.  Experience in causal Machine Learning and experimentation.  Proven problem solving and analytical abilities with solid software development skills in Python and SQL.  Experience in creating and integrating AI solutions with a smaller resource footprint at the hardware level.  Experience with TB or PB size datasets and Spark preferred.  Nice-to-have's include knowledge of user behavior in subscription and advertising-based video, auctions and/or advertising.  The Roku culture  Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.  We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

LegalZoom transformed the legal industry with the launch of our online services and groundbreaking technology in 2001.

As the industry leader for over 20 years, innovation remains at the center of all we do. We're creative thinkers and problem solvers with a passion for building legal and tax products that make a positive impact on the world, and we're always looking for exceptional people to push us further. With us, you'll do work that's as rewarding as it is challenging with a team where every voice matters and diversity, equality, and inclusion are truly embraced. Together, we'll continue to democratize the law and make a real difference in the lives of millions. Overview Fulfillment is an essential part of how LegalZoom serves its customers. While much of our platform is highly automated, sometimes the complexity of providing services across every state and thousands of counties requires human intervention. In some cases, the difference between whether a customer successfully files for the formation of their new business or gets their estate plans in place is the work performed by our fulfillment team. As a data scientist working with our fulfillment team, you will help us get better visibility into what happens between the time a customer places an order and they get the products and services that they need from LegalZoom. By better tracking and understanding what happens in fulfillment, we can make it faster and easier for customers to do business with us, drive increased automation of our products and services, and have a positive impact on LegalZoom’s bottom line. While you will initially focus on metrics and strategic recommendations, over time this role has the potential to play a key role in how we automate more of the work done in fulfillment. You will Perform descriptive and predictive analyses to form hypotheses about how we can grow the business by delivering products and services faster, reducing the need for customers to contact us, and increasing our level of automation Establish and lead work in delivering our analytical roadmap for Fulfillment Influence LegalZoom leadership to pursue our hypotheses so that we better serve customers and grow our business Identify, role model, and evangelize data science best practices so that others become better practitioners as well Design and run experiments to test our hypotheses, including the definition of metrics that will enable us to understand customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency Interpret experiment results and use them to drive strategic and tactical recommendations for how to better serve our customers Provide insights at scale through building pipelines and dashboards that share the metrics you’ve created to provide us a more complete view of our products and services Work closely with business leaders to help them better understand how to use data as well as form their own hypotheses so we can move faster You have Intellectually Curious  – You know that stones are put there to be turned over and are always trying to look at things in a different way. You can’t stop asking “why” until you get to the truth. Sees the Big Picture but Sweats the Details  – You never lose sight of why the work you're doing matters. At the same time, you know that the devil is in the details. When working with a new set of data for the first time, you trust but verify that data are correct and make sense. But above all, you always return to the original question and make sure you’re making progress in answering it. Speaks Up  - Being right a lot is important but only if it leads to others taking action. You speak up - especially when it seems controversial to do so - because you know that we’re all trying to do the right thing and want the best ideas to win. Technically Sound  – Your code is easy to read and is correct. You know SQL really well and can probably write some Python or R. You can use visualization tools such as Tableau or Superset to produce straightforward visualizations that people can understand. Your colleagues like working with the things you’ve built because they’re thoughtfully designed and well-constructed. Analytically Sound  – Your use of data and analytical techniques is sound. You understand the statistical underpinnings of experimentation and can design robust experiments. You define metrics that capture relevant customer behaviors in a way that doesn’t mislead. The models you build get the most predictive power out of the data because you understand how the techniques you’re using work and know how to transform data so that those techniques are most effective.

Since then, millions of customers have counted on us to officially start and run businesses, protect brands and intellectual property, and look after loved ones through wills and trusts. As the industry leader for over 20 years, innovation remains at the center of all we do. We're creative thinkers and problem solvers with a passion for building legal and tax products that make a positive impact on the world, and we're always looking for exceptional people to push us further. With us, you'll do work that's as rewarding as it is challenging with a team where every voice matters and diversity, equality, and inclusion are truly embraced. Together, we'll continue to democratize the law and make a real difference in the lives of millions. Overview The Data Science and Engineering team at LegalZoom helps us make measurably better decisions, faster. We do this through everything from shaping our product strategy to running experiments that let us know how well our strategy is performing. In this role, you will work closely with the Partnerships business to help them make data-driven decisions. The goal is to help customers build successful businesses by identifying and delivering offers from LegalZoom partners. Whether that offer is a business license, insurance, or any of our other partner offerings, your work is critical to providing the customer the right option at the right time. You will move nimbly between 1st and 3rd-party data sources and provide insights to Partner Managers and partners. You will work very closely with our colleagues in Engineering on everything from helping them build data-driven products to making sure that we are taking advantage of the latest advancements in data infrastructure (we are in the midst of migrating our data stack to the cloud). Examples of questions you’ll tackle include how do customers discover and opt-in to our partner offers, how can targeting improve conversion rates, and what other products and partner placements we should launch.   You will Perform descriptive and predictive analyses to form hypotheses about how we can grow the business through the delivery of better partner offerings, increased relevancy of our marketing efforts, and more efficient customer service experiences Establish and lead work in delivering our analytical roadmap for Partnerships Influence LegalZoom leadership to pursue our hypotheses so that we better serve customers and partners to help grow our business Identify, role model, and evangelize data science best practices so that others become better practitioners as well Train and mentor the Partnerships business and cross-functional teams to make better decisions using data Design and run experiments to test our hypotheses, including the definition of metrics that will enable us to understand customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency Interpret experiment results and use them to drive strategic and tactical recommendations for how to better serve our customers and partners Provide insights at scale through building pipelines and dashboards that share the metrics you’ve created to provide us a more complete view of our products and services Help us tell engaging and insightful stories with data to expand the footprint of our Partnerships business You have Intellectually Curious  – You know that stones are put there to be turned over and are always trying to look at things in a different way. You can’t stop asking “why” until you get to the truth. Sees the Big Picture but Sweats the Details  – You never lose sight of why the work you're doing matters. At the same time, you know that the devil is in the details. When working with a new set of data for the first time, you trust but verify that data are correct and make sense. But above all, you always true back to the original question and make sure you’re making progress in answering it. Speaks Up  - Being right a lot is important but only if it leads to others taking action. You speak up - especially when it seems controversial to do so - because you know that we’re all trying to do the right thing and want the best ideas to win. Technically Sound  – Your code is easy to read and is correct. You know SQL really well and can probably write some Python or R. You can use visualization tools such as Tableau or Superset to produce straightforward visualizations that people can understand. Your colleagues like working with the things you’ve built because they’re thoughtfully designed and well-constructed. Analytically Sound  – Your use of data and analytical techniques is sound. You understand the statistical underpinnings of experimentation and can design robust experiments. You define metrics that capture relevant customer behaviors in a way that doesn’t mislead. The models you build get the most predictive power out of the data because you understand how the techniques you’re using work and know how to transform data so that those techniques are most effective. Sometimes you break the rules but you know the rules and have a principled reason for why you are doing so. Good Learner  - There is far more out there to know than any one of us can know but if given a little time you can pick up whatever it is you need to know to do the job. You efficiently seek answers for yourself but also know when to ask for help. Intentional  – You know what your priorities are and why they are your priorities. When asked to help with something, you seek to understand why it is important and consider whether it makes sense to engage before saying yes. Relevant Experience  – You've done something like this before. Whether it be a previous role in data science and analytics or something where you had to demonstrate the above qualities, at the staff level we need you to have some prior experience. In some cases, this can come from your academic background which is probably something STEM or with a quantitative bent.  Join us in making a difference as we build our future and help ensure access to professional legal advice to all!
