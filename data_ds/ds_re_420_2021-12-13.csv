We’re committed to listening, learning, and responding to our team members and to making kwx and its family of companies a truly great place to work. Working with kwx is a win-win for agents, their clients and our kwx team.  OUR HISTORY. In 1983, Keller Williams was a rebel upstart fueled by Gary Keller’s philosophy of “people helping people” and a win-win culture. Its enduring belief system, WI4C2TES (Win-win, Integrity, Customers, Commitment, Communication, Creativity, Teamwork, Trust, Equity, and Success) keeps them anchored in doing the right thing. The company started to fuel entrepreneurial agents’ success, so agents can serve their clients like no others in the industry.  As Keller Williams grew to a market-leading organization, its culture spread, as did the commitment to give agents the training and tools to grow their businesses and profits. Keller Williams’ proud past set a foundation for a bright future.  As time went on, Keller Williams expanded its offerings to support their agents. While it started with Keller Williams Realty, Inc., it soon expanded with Keller Williams Worldwide and then added supporting services including Keller Mortgage, Keller Covered, and Keller Offers. In 2020, the concept of One Co., integrating all companies for a homeownership experience, took hold and kwx was launched.  OUR LEADERSHIP.

Our shared passion and commitment to delivering world-class customer experiences at scale made the opportunity to learn and lead alongside Gary Keller a compelling opportunity,” Liebert said. “KW has the market share, the vision and leadership, and unwavering commitment to keep the agent at the center of the holistic homeownership experience.”  Liebert’s focus for the kwx leadership team is to integrate the organization into one team with one mission; grow, engage, and retain the largest, most inclusive agent base; build the best-in-class data strategy and tech platform; build ancillary services and create a superior client experience across the ecosystem.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=05c05fda826fef0d&from=web&vjs=3,450,Bioinformatician Lead,Centaura,Remote,"Centaura is a Switzerland-based start-up company engaged in Systems and Molecular biology research. We are a young and ambitious team of radical thinkers from across the globe, making groundbreaking discoveries in aging research. Our projects are running in the USA, UK, and Russia. At Centaura, we believe that complex diseases, especially those associated with aging, can be prevented and ultimately reversed by applying new molecular biological tools and computational approaches. Our aim is to dive deep into biological datasets, develop multi-target therapies, and translate our scientific findings into real products available for the global community. We are actively seeking a team leader to coordinate multiomics data analytics projects aimed at developing targets and payloads for Centaura’s flagship next-generation gene therapy vector, the human artificial chromosome (HAC). The ideal candidate will also have experience with analysis of repetitive sequences and ChIP-seq data, which will allow them to contribute to the refinement of the HAC vectors. About the Project The HAC’s unique capabilities allow for multi-faceted approaches to gene therapy that put complex, multimodal non-Mendelian diseases into play. This includes those diseases that result from aging, as well as the aging process itself. Aging and its attendant diseases are the complex manifestations of the time-dependent loss of cellular homeostatic buffering capability, resulting in the functional decline of multiple organ systems. To combat aging and its related diseases, we will need to understand the timeline of the precipitating events during the period preceding the functional decline. We believe this is possible by leveraging large databases of “omics” data and applying advanced bioinformatic methods. These correlational associations (termed Aging Profiles) will then be tested for causal relationships with aging-associated phenomena by our molecular biology team. The pathways thus elucidated will then be targeted via HAC-based gene therapy as novel therapies for age-related disease. Position summary Together with your team, you will develop an algorithm to build these Aging Profiles. As the team leader, you will be responsible for building out your team, as well as identifying and gathering the datasets to mine for f novel aging pathways. You will work closely with the molecular biology team to test and validate these pathways, and, if necessary, assist with data-intensive molecular biological tasks. In this position, you will enjoy broad creative freedom to propose and pursue your ideas. Self-motivation, adaptability, and a strong passion for outstanding cutting-edge research are essential. The role described in this vacancy can be located remotely, though preference will be given to Boston-based candidates. You will report directly to the Chief Scientific Officer at Centaura. Tasks \- Identify and obtain necessary data from public sources and combine it with our existing datasets. \- Develop a comprehensive computational framework for integrating multi-omics and multi-tissue analyses and predicting aging modifiers: \- Data analysis pipeline for integrating various omics data into consistent formats and metrics. An example would be creating an age- cceleration/deceleration score, similar to an epigenetic clock biological vs chronological age differential \-Developing causal inferences from correlational data. Examples include:   directed network analysis of transcriptomic  data transcription factor binding enrichment pathway  enrichment analysis  regression modeling  \- Integrate machine learning-based methods to generate unexpected insights and develop longitudinal models of aging \- Apply innovative data visualization concepts \- Assist molecular biology teams with sequencing analysis and other data-centric problems (e.g. analysis of repetitive sequences and consensus motif discovery and refinement). \- Participate in design of wet lab experiments to test computationally derived models. \- Identify and resolve conflicts in meeting technical needs \- Engage and support the product development process Requirements Strong scientific background in epidemiology/systems or computational biology/computer science/mathematics 3-5 years post-qualification experience as a data scientist, systems biologist or in a similar role Experience in the analysis of large-scale omics data Experience in machine learning or other modeling methods Full English proficiency Additional qualifications desired Strong knowledge of modern ML algorithms and the limits of their application Experience in deep learning frameworks - Keras/TensorFlow/PyTorch and an understanding of neural network architectures (CNN, RNN, etc.) Broad understanding of relational databases, SQL, and ability to design a database with several dozen entities Experience with ChIP-seq data and motif discovery Some experience in aging research, gene editing, optimization techniques, cell culture techniques, general molecular biology methods, and/or imaging.
