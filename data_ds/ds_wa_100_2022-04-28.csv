You have several years of experience managing and scaling multiple teams. Data Experience at scale:  You’ve been a leader in companies where data science was used on top of massive data sets to drive product/business decisions and resulted in powerful data products. You have extensive experience with languages like SQL, Spark, and Python. Natural Language Processing (NLP):  You've had experience using NLP tools to drive wide scale impact for a business.

You have multiple years of experience managing decisions at scale, including causal inference and experimentation. Well-balanced skills:  People have trouble pinning you down. Business, product, and technical teams claim you as their own. You are equal parts technical and functional (and both are exceptionally strong), and you are equally comfortable and effective at presenting to technical or business leaders. Passionate about business strategy:  You’ve experienced and thrived in similar channel-related environments and have a knack for working with business users that are responsible for top-line growth.

Further, product substitutability is difficult and potentially costly to measure as our products are not commodity goods that are repeatedly purchased (e.g. the customer needs  the perfect sofa for their living room ). We build generalized, unified models in the form of rich, concise representations to address these challenges and power decision making across Wayfair. These are used as i) features for other science models predicting customer engagement with our products, ii) through scalable search systems for discovering exact or substitutes across our catalog or our competitors', and iii) validation of substitution to drive end-to-end efficiency in product sourcing, on-site recommendations, and distribution.  What You’ll Do   Provide technical leadership in the development of state-of-the-art deep learning models that unify image and text similarity understanding, and predict substitutability from product information and customer feedback.

After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.           Job Description    The Payment Platform is an open, global financial services platform for developers who serve sellers. It provides the necessary components to manage identity, process payments across multiple channels, hold and transfer funds, and provide accounting, reconciliation, and reporting in a secure and compliant way.        We process billions of dollars worth of transactions every year. At that scale, even small optimizations can lead to a major impact. As a Machine Learning Engineer on Payment Platform, you will partner with software engineers, product managers, and data scientists to seamlessly integrate machine learning into our payment processing. Current work includes building models to optimize pricing, improve payment routing, reduce decline rates, and predict transaction costs.

We partner with business, product, and engineering teams to drive optimal decision-making using sophisticated modeling and machine learning techniques. We’re a passionate team of scientists and engineers who are shipping machine learning models that make payments efficient, effective, and low-cost for Square.
