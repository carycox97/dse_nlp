We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore, we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud. We stop them. We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. DS@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception. The human we need for this role will work on  BotGuard : our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.  What you will do: Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product. Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work. Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you. Who you are: You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!). You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.  Benefits & Perks Unlimited PTO Private medical and dental insurance for all full-time employees Fully paid parental leave Learning & Development budget Phenomenal coaching from senior leaders and challenging development opportunities Monthly internet, phone bill, and meal stipend to support working remotely during COVID-19 Company-sponsored TalkSpace membership for you and your family  Life at HUMAN: Our HQ office is located in the heart of New York City. We are growing the company deliberately with a keen eye towards maintaining values that embody diversity, lifestyle, and career growth. We are doing substantial work, and we need people to join our mighty team. We are proud of our overwhelmingly positive presence on Glassdoor and Built in NYC.

Research Associate: Data Scientist Cornell Lab of Ornithology College of Agriculture & Life Sciences Ithaca NY The Cornell Lab of Ornithology is a globally focused institution with the mission to interpret and conserve the earth’s biological diversity through research, education, and citizen science focused on birds. The Center for Avian Population Studies (CAPS) is one of the major programmatic units at the Lab and home to eBird, a global citizen science project that has become the largest biodiversity monitoring system in existence. By engaging hundreds of thousands of volunteers worldwide, eBird functions as an on-the-ground avian sensor network providing an unparalleled source of fine-scale, year-round information on bird populations. The goal of the eBird Status and Trends (S&T) project is to use the information collected by eBird to become the go-to source for publicly available high-quality, high-resolution data visualizations, and tools describing where bird populations occur and how they change through time. To translate eBird observations into robust data products we use custom modeling workflows designed to fill spatiotemporal gaps based on remote sensing data while controlling for the biases inherent in species observations collected by volunteers. The workflow generates estimates of species’ distributions and abundance, measures how they change over time, and identifies the features of the environment associated with populations. Leveraging the broad coverage and fine scale of eBird, these estimates are generated with high resolution across global extents making it possible to address a wide variety of important ecological and conservation applications. Job Description/Position Function:   To achieve these goals the eBird Status and Trends (S&T) project is seeking a Data Scientist to join our team. This work is at the interface of machine learning, statistics, and ecology and will span a range of topics from sampling design, exploratory analysis, visualization, and discovery to prediction, validation, quantification of uncertainty, and statistical inference. The Data Scientist will play a leading role researching and developing the quantitative analyses used to generate and apply S&T data products. You will work closely with other team scientists to improve and extend models of species’ distributions, abundance, and trends, as well as developing new methods to create additional data products. Common challenges we encounter include the separation of dynamic, multiscale ecological signals from the inherently noisy, biased observations collected by volunteers in a data-rich, big data production-scale environment. The Data Scientist will also participate in projects demonstrating how S&T data products can be used in impactful ecological and conservation applications and decision-making activities. This will take place through internal collaborations with CAPS and Lab scientists as well as with external partners and collaborators. Duties and Responsibilities: Research (50%) Develop a research program aligned with the vision and strategic goals of the S&T project and the Center for Avian Population Studies. Improve and extend existing species distribution, abundance, and trend models to have better precision, accuracy, geographic, taxonomic scope, uncertainty estimates & computational efficiency.

Backed by some of the leading scientific minds in immunology, oncology, and single cell genomics, we are up for the challenge. Immunai has begun the process of mapping millions of immune cells and their functions in order to build a proprietary data set for clinical immunological data. The immune system mapping will play an important role in boosting R&D efforts in developing targeted therapies for different diseases. The company noted that the immune system consists of trillions of cells that are divided into different cell types that perform different functions. Because of the complexity of the system, it can be difficult to determine how drugs will interact with the immune cells. This increased understanding can be used to boost clinical response to different cellular therapies. Immunai’s mission is to map the immune system with neural networks and transfer learning techniques informed by deep immunology knowledge.

This role can be based our of our offices in New York, NY, Atlanta, GA, or be fully remote (US Only).  Your Mandate   Identify any and all opportunities to better leverage data to inform strategy.

Please note: we have this role posted under a few different titles as there is not universal alignment on titles in the data world. In the interest of transparency, here is how we think about the nuances of titles with regard to this role:   Analytics Engineer: this best captures a need for technical rigor; however, it may not clearly stress the importance of finding someone with a very strong business sense.  Data Analyst: this is perhaps the most “accurate,” but it may not articulate the technical requirements; we also fear there may be a stigma against this title as “data scientist” may appeal to more people.  Data Scientist: this is most likely resonant with the market, but will likely generate the most noise as it has become a pretty large bucket of different skills and interests.   This article, written by Andrew Bartholomew, summarizes how we are thinking about this role.

From the creator of the popular framework PyTorch Lightning, Grid is a platform for training models that enables rapid research iteration. Grid aims to simplify scalable AI research so that when a network becomes complex, code doesn't.  Focus on Machine Learning, Not Infrastructure.  Grid.ai is backed by $18.6 million in funding from Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Firstminute. Grid is a remote-first company founded by William Falcon and Luis Capelo.  What's important to us  We are building a company of people that care deeply about the impact of AI on our society. We value:   Integrity: AI is bound to change how we interact with computers, with each other, and the world—for the better. We are committed to building an inclusive company and developing ethical AI that improves humanity.  Perseverance: Be bold, take the initiative, and make decisions with confidence. We empower our community, clients, and colleagues to tackle the impossible.  Curiosity: We are genuinely interested in finding solutions to advance the state of AI research and foster its application in novel products. It's not about whether we can solve the problem, but how.  We also feel that it's essential to point out the self-evident here – there's a genuine lack of diversity in our industry, which has to change. One of our goals is to help drive that change. Grid.ai is fully committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of its practices, especially when it comes to growing our team. Our culture promotes inclusion, and we embrace how rewarding it is to work with people from all walks of life.  What we're looking for  We are looking for a Solutions Architect with expertise in machine learning and distributed systems to serve as the technical liaison to qualify and close opportunities with customers and partners. You will report to Robert Lee, our Head of Sales Engineering, and work closely with Armen Kopoyan, our Head of Sales, Alex Cort, our Business Development Manager, and the product team.  This is a chance for you to help bring groundbreaking technology that will transform the machine learning ecosystem to market!  What you'll do  Become a product expert with an in-depth understanding of target markets, value proposition, user personas, and pricing models.  Introduce customers to Grid's core product offering and educate each potential client on the platform's unique capabilities based on their business needs.  Lead product and solution briefings, build proof-of-concepts (POC), run live product demos, and prototype Grid integrations while identifying and addressing key technical objections.  Define and execute engineering strategies to resolve blockers to adoption and utilization.  Build a technical feedback loop between potential customers and Grid's sales, customer success, product, and marketing teams to inform the product roadmap with key information about requested features and client challenges.  How we evaluate your candidacy  Our interviews will not only give us insight into your skillset, but give you insight into our company.   Head of People Introduction- 30 minutes:  You will speak with our Head of People about your background and what you are looking for in your next role.

The interview will dive deeper into how you work best with the sales team, your expertise in solutions architecture, your ability to succeed in competitive situations, and what makes your approach unique and effective.  Head of Sales Interview - 30 minutes:  This interview is focused on how you will engage with customers throughout the sales process. You will speak with Armen about your approach to solutions architecture and customer success, how to gather technical details from prospects, collaborating on issue escalation, and what to do to create a memorable, positive customer experience from the first introduction.  VP of Strategy Interview - 45 minutes:  As a data scientist himself, our VP of Strategy has evaluated almost every machine learning platform out there, so this interview will be more of a role-playing exercise. Based on what you know about our core product, you will act as if Marc is a potential customer and you are already our first Solutions Architect. During the second half of the interview, you will have a chance to discuss the pain points of model building, as well as the pros and cons of Grid.ai's current offering across multiple areas. Prior to this interview, please sign up for an account on our website and try the product out for yourself.  Culture Chat - 30 minutes:  We take time to speak with every candidate about our values, Ethics in AI, and how our technology can be used to create a positive social impact.  Technical   Customer Presentation - 30 minutes:  One of the key parts of a solutions architect's role is to showcase your knowledge of machine learning, and specifically, ML infrastructure and training ML models. You will create a 20-minute presentation to a potential customer of your choice. Spend the first 5 minutes explaining the customer's business and use case before diving into the pitch itself. We want you to dig into our differentiators versus our competitors in the space. This is an interactive interview, so be ready to think on your feet, discuss your thought process, and answer questions from the audience.  CEO - 30 minutes:  William Falcon, our CEO, likes to connect with every person joining our company. Be prepared to talk a bit about what you've learned and why you'd like to work with us.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=1a1bc359f32dbcc6&from=web&vjs=3,490,Senior Developer Advocate - AI & Machine Learning,Grid.ai,New York State,"Who we are  Grid.ai enables companies of all sizes to train state-of-the-art AI models on hundreds of cloud GPUs and TPUs from their laptops. From the creator of the popular framework PyTorch Lightning, Grid is a platform for training models that enables rapid research iteration. Grid aims to simplify scalable AI research so that when a network becomes complex, code doesn't.  Focus on Machine Learning, Not Infrastructure.  Grid.ai is backed by $18.6 million in funding from Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Firstminute. Grid is a remote-first company founded by William Falcon and Luis Capelo.  What's important to us  We are building a company of people that care deeply about the impact of AI on our society. We value:   Integrity: AI is bound to change how we interact with computers, with each other, and the world—for the better. We are committed to building an inclusive company and developing ethical AI that improves humanity.  Perseverance: Be bold, take the initiative, and make decisions with confidence. We empower our community, clients, and colleagues to tackle the impossible.  Curiosity: We are genuinely interested in finding solutions to advance the state of AI research and foster its application in novel products. It's not about whether we can solve the problem, but how.  We also feel that it's essential to point out the self-evident here – there's a genuine lack of diversity in our industry, which has to change. One of our goals is to help drive that change. Grid.ai is fully committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of its practices, especially when it comes to growing our team. Our culture promotes inclusion, and we embrace how rewarding it is to work with people from all walks of life.  What We're Looking For  As more developers use Grid and Lightning, we are actively investing in our user communities. This is an opportunity for you to shape the developer experience in the AI space while driving the adoption and utilization of technology that will transform the machine learning ecosystem as a whole. At Grid.ai, developer advocacy centers around 3 tenants:   Community:  Our goal is to amplify the community's voice within the company by increasing engagement, gathering feedback, and working together.  Content:  From writing blog posts, drafting articles, and producing videos to building demos and developing our documentation, we want to ensure that our users have the resources they need to get started and learn about the latest ways to use Grid and Lightning!  Engineering:  At the end of the day, we are all engineers. We connect with developers in the field, foster strong relationships with internal teams, and work together on prioritizing feedback to inform discovery and roadmap development.  What You'll Do  Amplify the Lightning and Grid Community by connecting with users in the community Slack, speaking at meetups and conferences, and hosting Community Office Hours and Technical Community Sprints.  Launch the first Grid and Lightning Ambassadors Program to foster community and create champions for our products.  Write technical content and documentation, including open source repos, blog posts, case studies, and documentation to enable engineers, scientists, and researchers to do more with Grid and Lightning.  Collaborate with the product and engineering teams to share the voice of the community and improve the developer experience as a whole.  Actively build demos on top of lightning using PyTorch, Lightning, and Grid.  Represent the company at conferences and meetups virtually (and across the globe when it's safe) to connect with our community, meet our users, and host fun, engaging events.  How we evaluate your candidacy  Our interviews will not only give us insight into your skillset but give you insight into our company.

We want to know why you are interested in joining us and what questions you have about the team.

You will share your thoughts on connecting with end-users, gathering feedback, and creating champions within our community.  Virtual Onsite - 3 hours:  You'll have the opportunity to meet with our Head of Developer Advocacy, as well as a product manager, marketing specialist, and software engineer for 30-45 minutes each and work through exercises spanning community building, technical content creation, culture, and NLP, Computer Vision, or Audio Processing Tasks.

These teams are both part of a group called Technical Excellence, which also is made up of 5 sector-specific Technical Units advising on our main programming areas (Education, Economic Recovery and Development, Governance, Health, and Violence Prevention and Response) across six different regions of the world. The Senior Data Analyst will be responsible for leading the analysis (and sometimes collection and cleaning) of data relevant to Technical Excellence leaders. This will mean managing and analyzing sophisticated metrics to measure progress across key strategic areas, including program design, client satisfaction, partnerships volume, client reach, research and evidence, programmatic quality assurance, business development, staffing capacity, and more. While some analyses will be repeated (quarterly, for example) other requests may be one-off or require partnership with other departments such as Finance, IT, or technical and implementing program teams. This role will respond principally to inquiries from Technical Excellence leadership asking how we can utilize multiple complex internal datasets and databases to offer management insights into whether we are achieving our strategic goals and where our resources (financial and human) should be allocated. The datasets of focus for the Senior Data Analyst will likely span from budgets and spending data to win rates, grants tracking, time & effort salary tracking, and programmatic data.  The successful Analyst will need to have a (moderate) tolerance for messy or imperfect data sets, and an enthusiasm for working to improve systems from within. This role will be a thought partner as well as analytic support for our strategic plan (Strategy 100) leaders to ensure their targets can be measured, tracked, triangulated, discussed with nuance, and presented clearly. The Data Analyst will also be asked to provide recommendations on system enhancements that would help us capture, store, and better analyze the data needed to answer questions from leadership. As the role evolves, the Analyst will take on a proactive role planning for and coordinating data needs across Technical Excellence, advising on what would help us build a coherent and useful data ecosystem from both available and planned datasets.  The Senior Data Analyst will fill a critical (and in demand!) gap in the department, becoming an organizational expert in multiple large datasets and providing advice to staff at many levels about the best ways to use and compare internal data. The role is a new position, and the ideal Analyst will not just be a skilled, accurate number cruncher, but also a clear communicator thinking creatively to help those less comfortable with our data to plan how to use it for better decision making. The role will focus on people (mentoring colleagues and explaining concepts), processes (cleaning data, statistical analyses, establishing routines for data planning and review), and technology (Power BI visualization, data extraction, and data architecture).  Major Responsibilities:   Analyze grants, finance, and program data from potentially all IRC data collection systems and databases (systems are called BVA/SUN, Integra, OTIS, Annual Statistics, and more)   Lead, manage, and support analytical projects for Technical Excellence leadership and our strategic plan leaders (Strategy 100), from programmatic analyses to financial analyses to HR analyses to projections and revenue forecasting, to inform decisions on resource allocation and help leaders monitor progress against organizational goals   Establish routines for data usage and reporting, and lead the continuous improvement of data routines   Support data reformatting and cleaning necessary to use our data to answer strategic questions   Help leaders craft metrics and tracking approaches to answer their questions, understanding the limitations of different data sources   Become an organizational expert on the strengths, weaknesses, and value of different internal datasets   Help colleagues understand and interpret data   Coordinate, consolidate, analyze, summarize, and visualize data into meaningful reports for relevant IRC departments   Support and sometimes lead the preliminary analysis/reporting for Technical Excellence leadership data review meetings and some Leadership Board quarterly strategic review content   Support other Technical Excellence and Strategy 100 leaders with their preparation for and delivery of internal presentations  Key Working Relationships:  You will report to:  the Deputy Director, Program Quality Strategy  and  the Director, Grant Operations and Analytics Team  Desired Qualifications:   5+ years of progressive work experience connected to data analytics   Successful experience analyzing complex sets of data and disseminating data that can be used to drive strategy and policy making   Experience using visualization tools such as PowerBI or Tableau   Tolerance for imperfect data and an excitement for finding insights in complicated data sources   Aptitude for and interest in offering creative solutions to problems discovered within our systems and procedures   Highly collaborative and pro-active colleague with a talent for delivering results with cross-functional groups   Strong communicator, with experience helping to demystify data for teammates   Some experience with data governance is a plus   Experience working with IRC data systems is a plus   Dedication to diversity, equity and inclusion, and a strong passion for our mission   Comfortable adapting to new challenges and dynamic priorities, while maintaining professional grace and (ideally!) a sense of humor  Advanced Microsoft Office skills (Excel, Powerpoint) and experience with organizational information and financial systems   Excellent written and verbal communication skills in a multi-cultural environment  University degree in Business Administration, Finance, International Development or a relevant quantitative field, or equivalent work experience   Fluent in English; French, Spanish or Arabic language a plus  Working Environment (assumes NY office)   Standard office working environment, flexibility to work remotely a significant amount of the time   Workspace booked via a desk reservation system in an open-plan office when in person   Limited travel expected   This role may require working remotely full or part time depending on pandemic and public health changes  Values and Legal Disclaimers  The IRC and IRC workers must adhere to the values and principles outlined in IRC Way - Standards for Professional Conduct.

Nautilus is building artificial intelligence to advance the efficiency of ocean commerce. We deliver technology to help shipping companies minimize fuel consumption, maximize operational efficiency, and optimize fleet performance. By arming ship owners and operators with real-time predictive decision support, Nautilus is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and making global trade sustainable.  Ocean shipping consumes over $100 billion dollars of fuel every year, and up to 30% of it can be saved. For owner-operators, reliance on manually collected and analyzed data makes it difficult to optimize fleet performance in real-time. By providing a unified data platform that leverages machine learning, Nautilus helps its clients make better decisions to maximize the return on each ship and every voyage. For our clients, this means they drive closer collaboration, greater transparency, and stronger accountability across their global teams every day.   About you.  We are hiring a Data Scientist to join the Nautilus Labs team. You are inquisitive and enjoy exploring new research questions, and are capable of working largely independently.

You will work closely with other data scientists, data analysts, and software engineers to build, test, and deploy robust ship performance models. You will partner with our product team to help conceptualize, design, and implement new machine learning-based products. While we are a collaborative team, you will also be expected to take independent ownership of specific research and development projects. Your work will help drive product development throughout the Nautilus team, and support better client decision-making to help meet their fuel efficiency and sustainability goals.   Proficiencies.   2+ years of professional experience and/or an advanced degree, with a background in data science, statistics, computer science, physics, naval architecture, mechanical engineering, or another related quantitative field.
