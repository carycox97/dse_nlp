Multiple times a day, GEOS combines millions of real-time observations from around the globe with the billions of variables output from the model to produce the best guess of the atmospheric state. This monumental data science problem, known as data assimilation, presents a number of challenges: how to optimally combine all of the data in a physically sensible way, and how to assess the value of the information we have. There are numerous approaches to data assimilation, but adjoint-based techniques are used in the world’s leading forecast systems. As such, GMAO maintains an adjoint version of the GEOS model and uses it in several important data assimilation applications. However, adjoint model development can be a difficult process. It relies on a linearization of the model equations, many of which are nonlinear. In addition, the nonlinear model development progresses rapidly, and keeping the adjoint version in sync can be challenging; adjoint models must be extremely efficient, and automated generation (differentiation) tools are less helpful in this respect. Recently, two areas or research have arisen that can be applied to adjoint development to make it more streamlined. First is machine learning. In a machine learning approach, a neural network is trained to emulate the behavior of some component of the GEOS model. Once trained, the adjoint of that emulation would be readily available due to the inherent use of adjoints in neural network methodology. Neural network emulations are typically much faster than the model they emulate and can be trained again with relative ease as the underlying model changes. This makes them an appealing alternative for generating adjoint models. The second technology is the Local Ensemble Tangent Linear Models (LETLM), where an ensemble of model forecasts is used to generate the adjoint version of the model. Like a machine learning approach, this would eliminate the need to develop the adjoint model explicitly and would account for nonlinearity in the underlying system. A novel approach to adjoint development harnessing these techniques has the potential to unleash a new era of adjoint-based data assimilation and advance weather forecasting.
