Texas Health and Human Services Commission  will pay no fees for interviews or discussions, which occur during the process of selecting a Candidate(s). As the State of Texas rushes to address the many impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become critical to rely on the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) to provide reliable, up to the minute data regarding the current state of infection in the state. As DSHS works to provide this critical data to inform decision makers, health care administrators and citizens, the agency is experiencing serious limitations in the ability to efficiently and reliably provide the data due to a legacy of disparate systems and data that currently resides in numerous locations and databases across the agency. Sharing this vital data across all of these systems is inherently difficult, time-consuming, and requires resource intensive manual and inefficient processes. These cumbersome manual processes have a severe impact on Texas’ ability to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the loss of life. The State Health Analytics and Reporting Platform (SHARP) project is intended to expand the capacity of current DSHS analytical infrastructure. An integrated approach to data services will aid in providing the most current data to inform decision makers about the health and readiness statuses of jurisdictions across the state. SHARP aims to create a data analytics platform plus data governance with Informatica Axon. The SHARP platform will facilitate the sharing, reporting, and analytics of the data collected from various ingested datasets, which will be greatly enhanced by the addition of a Machine Learning capability.
