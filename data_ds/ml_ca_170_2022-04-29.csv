Our technology helps our customers solve their toughest challenges by enabling them to make better, more informed decisions in life-and-death situations. We’ve assembled a diverse team of experts in software development, artificial intelligence, computer vision, sensor fusion, optics, and data analysis to create software and hardware solutions that radically evolve the capabilities of the United States and our allies. If you are passionate about solving problems that have real impact, come join Anduril and build the future of defense.                  Team overview              The Mission Operations team is responsible for managing the execution, growth, and success of our customer accounts. Working across product, engineering, and growth, our Mission Operations Engineers own customer relationships and develop, plan, and deploy Anduril solutions in support of critical mission sets. They work side-by-side with customers to understand their specific problem sets and then shape Anduril’s offerings alongside our engineering teams to fit the mission needs. Because the problems we solve are uniquely challenging, our Mission Operations Engineers naturally gravitate toward finding solutions and are adept at navigating organizational hurdles. They are ultimately responsible for customer and mission success and therefore play a critical role in the shaping and future of Anduril Industries.                  Anduril’s JADC2 team is focused on bringing real-time battle management capabilities to the US military, using our Lattice OS as the backbone to accelerate kill chains and decision making. We pursue select efforts with DOD and Allied customers that present an opportunity to rapidly build, deploy, and iterate against high-value concepts of operation. The team is looking for someone familiar with USN battle management platforms, C2 systems, integrations, workflows, and ConOps who can lead the execution and management of our growing Navy C2 account.                  Role overview                   What You’ll Do               Orchestrate the deployment of Anduril’s JADC2 solution.  Lead the planning and deployment of Anduril’s Lattice software suite in support of critical customer mission sets. Through collaboration with our program, engineering, and growth teams, the Navy C2 Account Lead is in charge of shaping customer use cases, articulating workflows, training end users, and ensuring the high performance of our software to the US Navy. We are obsessed about engagement and keeping our finger on the pulse of how customers interact with Lattice. This helps us improve the user experience and evolve their operational tactics and techniques. And if something isn’t quite right, we work with product teams to quickly address the issue on behalf of our customer.              Shape our products to meet mission needs.  An understanding of USN command and control systems is important. You will work side-by-side with our customers to understand their specific mission challenges and then represent the customer as you work with Anduril engineers to shape products that solve critical national and international security challenges. Anduril engineers rely on Mission Operators to understand the lay of the land and bring a perspective that informs the product development process.              Grow your business through customer success.  In addition to the operational and executive relationships you own, you will partner with our sales team in capturing additional opportunities that drive top line growth. This requires establishing committed and trust-based partnerships with our customers to not only help them solve their immediate problems, but also to foresee future opportunities where Anduril’s technology can make them more effective. Understanding Anduril’s value proposition and articulating how we can have an impact on a customer’s problem set, from the executive level to the end user, is critical to positioning Anduril for the future.              Collaborate across nearly every Anduril team.  Successfully deploying our complex product suite requires collaborating with nearly every internal Anduril team - engineering, product, logistics, finance, legal, contracting, technical operations, and many more.

We put the needs of the mission and our customers first and understand that the US and its allies have no preordained right to victory in any future conflict. We actively seek out opportunities to better understand our customers’ mission needs, with a goal to build the best possible products for the warfighter and radically evolve our national and international defense capabilities. We push ourselves and the limits of our capabilities in the pursuit of this goal.              Ownership Mentality.  We’re looking for owners; those who have a natural bias to assume responsibility, a healthy dose of skepticism, and contribute to a culture of performance. We empower our Mission Operators to quickly assume high levels of responsibility and entrust them to actively own their account and shape its success. Our Mission Operators are just as comfortable helping to shape a proposal or pitch a new customer as they are working with engineers on new features or deploying products at government locations.              Technical Aptitude and Intellectual Curiosity.  We are first and foremost a technology company, working at the leading edge of capabilities like machine learning, autonomy, distributed networking, and multi-modal sensor fusion. Do you have a natural desire to see beyond simple cause and effect relationships to really understand how complex systems operate? Do you actively seek out opportunities to educate yourself? These capabilities form the foundation of our product offerings, so we are looking for those who are comfortable communicating technical concepts and can articulate them in the context of the customer’s mission.
