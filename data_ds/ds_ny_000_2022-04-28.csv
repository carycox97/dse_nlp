Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Verification Engine, the backbone of all our products that protect enterprises from sophisticated bots. Today we verify the humanity of more than 15 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms across the internet.                  Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to helping protect companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by malicious bots. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive benefits and day-to-day culture in order for every human to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).                  The HUMAN R&D team is pivotal to our mission to protect the heart of the internet by disrupting the economics of cybercrime. They are the ones uncovering and fighting bot operations like PARETO, ICEBUCKET, 3ve, and Methbot. HUMAN supports our R&D humans by strongly valuing deep work and flexibility. Company-wide meeting-free Fridays give you uninterrupted time to work on your projects. Additionally, this team is encouraged to participate in R&D Research Friday - a designated half-day each week dedicated to trying new ideas and personal career development. HUMAN is fully committed to flexible working arrangements, or as we call it, work from anywhere, anytime. All of this is to ensure our humans are able to do the best work of their lives.                  We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN.                  DS@HUMANsec              The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception.                  The human we need for this role will work on      BotGuard : our product for cybersecurity and account protection. BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.                    What you will do:             Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product.  Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work.  Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate.  Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy.  Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers.  Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you.                          Who you are:             You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!).  You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers.  You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate.  Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well.  You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles.  You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.                          Benefits & Perks             Unlimited PTO  Private medical and dental insurance for all full-time employees  Fully paid parental leave  Learning & Development budget  Phenomenal coaching from senior leaders and challenging development opportunities  Monthly internet, phone bill, and meal stipend to support working remotely during COVID-19  Company-sponsored TalkSpace membership for you and your family                          Life at HUMAN:                   HUMAN  prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!                  With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, with teams in London, Virginia, and Victoria, we trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The benefits package we provide reflects our remote-first culture and our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development. We also offer weekly lunches, flexible time off, no-meeting Fridays, HUMAN days, sabbatical programs, and so much more.                  We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.

We build smart indoor farms near cities, growing fresher, pesticide-free Protected Produce with bold flavor in precisely controlled environments, 365 days a year. At the heart of each farm is the proprietary BoweryOS, which integrates software, hardware, sensors, AI, computer vision systems, machine learning models, and robotics to orchestrate and automate the entirety of its operations. As a result, each farm creates far less waste and uses a fraction of the water and land compared to traditional agriculture. For more insight on our culture, our teams, and all the things that make us so unique, check out  The Roots: Bowery Farming's People Podcast .   * About The Role: *   This is an opportunity to join a small, growing team and make a substantial impact at Bowery. We’re looking for someone that can learn, adapt and roll with a fast-paced, ever-changing environment and who isn’t afraid of uncertainty.   Data analysis at Bowery means building data pipelines, crafting data visualizations, and helping a wide range of teams interpret reams of data generated by “the Techiest Farm in the World.” The data function at Bowery is central to the vision of the company as well as its day-to-day operation. You’ll be part of the Data & AI team which is responsible for everything from collecting data, to reporting facts, investigative analysis, building machine learning, and computer vision models.   This role is based out of our NYC HQ. We follow a hybrid working model.   What You'll Do:       Develop SQL to transform the raw data produced by the farm into a comprehensive data warehouse as the authoritative source for all facts about the business.    Build automated reporting which effectively draws attention to important information and helps decision-makers understand our priorities.    Partner with other functional areas to develop metrics, understand analytical needs and interpret results about our crops and our business.    Collaborate on the design and creation of data tools and decision frameworks used by our farm operators, agricultural scientists, and sales team to drive positive change.

What You'll Have:       You are fluent in SQL, have opinions about a well-designed database, and know how to deal with data too big to analyze in memory.    You are comfortable working in a highly technical team: contributing through version control, peer-reviewing code, and managing processes in production.    You are comfortable being the technical resource for non-technical teams: translating business needs to technical requirements, communicating quantitative observations to make the teams around us more effective and well-informed.    You’ve got a natural attention to detail and drive for order that yields accuracy and reliability in the data you work with.    You can own the critical trust-based relationship with our internal stakeholders.    You have experience in and a passion for visualizing data to tell clear stories and support decision-making.    You have some familiarity with data science languages like R or python, and enjoy learning more.

You believe that teams succeed and fail together and take responsibility for ensuring the success and safety of your teammates.     Who We Are:       Bowery is a place where everyone is welcome, included and empowered to reach their full potential.

Cornell University Lab of Ornithology is seeking a  Data Science Developer  to join the Avian Population Studies team.        The Center for Avian Population Studies (CAPS) is one of the major programmatic units at the Lab and home to eBird, a global citizen science project that collects millions of bird observations from thousands of participants around the world each year. This rapidly growing dataset is revolutionizing avian ecology, by providing unprecedented information on bird abundance across space and time. With this data, scientists in the eBird Status and Trends project use machine learning and statistical methods to combine observations of birds with habitat information from satellites to predict and estimate bird occurrence, abundance, and trends at a high spatiotemporal resolution. The data products generated from this project are a rich source of ecological information that can be explored, visualized, and analyzed in many ways for a variety of audiences, from advancing ecological science and informing precision on-the-ground conservation, to inspiring people to appreciate birds and the natural world in compelling new ways.        What You Will Do     As the Data Scientist Developer, you will work in a team of other data scientists, data engineers, ecologists, conservation scientists, and data visualization developers to,         support a wide variety of data science activities on production and research systems to advance large-scale production workflows,      transform and integrate data products for novel applications and visualizations,      derive and summarize insights and inferences from large and complex datasets, and      develop analysis for scientific research projects.           This will include the use of both machine learning and statistical methods to design, implement, test, validate, interpret, and quantify uncertainty of models for prediction and inference based on citizen science. This will require a detailed knowledge of R to develop analysis code that fits within existing workflows, and interface with other data scientists on the team. Production work will require the use of Unix shell, ssh, git and in-house software to perform analyses via jobs submitted to a scheduler in a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment. To achieve these goals, the Data Scientist Developer will collaborate with various team members across CAPS to identify and solve questions and problems related to advancing our analysis in novel ways.        What We Need from You         Bachelor’s degree and 3 to 5 years relevant experience in data science practice, or equivalent combination.      Experience designing, implementing, testing & validating, and interpreting machine learning and statistical methods for exploratory data analysis, prediction, and inference.      Familiarity with spatial data analysis and a variety of spatial data formats.      Minimum of 2 years experience using R regularly, ideally in a production system.      Proven experience documenting and testing code and using Git for code management.      Familiarity with big data concepts and methods for scaling analyses.

Experience writing project requirements and working directly with designers and software engineers.           If you possess these experiences and skills, this may be the role for you!     We would view these additional qualifications as incredibly helpful in this role:         Master’s degree with 5-7 years of experience designing, implementing, testing & validating, and interpreting machine learning and statistical methods with big, ecological and environmental datasets, preferably working within a team of other data scientists and data engineers.

About Syracuse University                 Syracuse University is a private, international research university with distinctive academics, diversely unique offerings and an undeniable spirit. Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and nearly 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.              The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors and 100 minors offered through 13 schools and colleges; nearly 15,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit www.syracuse.edu.                              About the Syracuse area                 Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.                              EEOC                 Syracuse University is an equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.                              Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans                 Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.                              Commitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community                 Syracuse University maintains an inclusive learning environment in which students, faculty, administrators, staff, curriculum, social activities, governance, and all other aspects of campus life reflect a diverse, multi-cultural, and international worldview. The University community recognizes and values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to understand, live among, appreciate, and work in an inherently diverse country and world made up of people with different ethnic and racial backgrounds, military backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, cultural traditions, abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities. To do so, we commit ourselves to promoting a community that celebrates and models the principles of diversity and inclusivity.                ",30+ days ago,575 reviews,"2,177"

After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting.

We partner with business, product, and engineering teams to drive optimal decision-making using sophisticated modeling and machine learning techniques. We’re a passionate team of scientists and engineers who are shipping machine learning models that make payments efficient, effective, and low-cost for Square.

We’re dedicated to empowering this transformation by building the tools and infrastructure developers need to create their own products. Plaid powers the tools millions of people rely on to live a healthier financial life. We work with thousands of companies like Venmo and SoFi, several of the Fortune 500, and many of the largest banks to make it easy for people to connect their financial accounts to the apps and services they want to use. Plaid’s network covers 11,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada, UK and Europe. Founded in 2013, the company is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in New York, Salt Lake City, Washington D.C., London and Amsterdam.                  Transactions Platform gives Plaid products access to the full potential of transactions data, our largest and richest dataset. While the domain-specific interpretation of transactions varies wildly between use cases, the basics remain the same: “what type of transaction is this?”, “what are the recurring trends in this account’s history?”, “what merchants/organizations does this consumer interact with?”. The mission of Transactions Platform is to make answering these questions trivial, so that the Product teams can focus on their core competency, and not on building yet another regex pattern library. We take a holistic approach, from studying the data available and designing high-quality labeling pipelines to training ML models and implementing structural parsers.                  As a member of our team, you’ll collaborate with product stakeholders (PMs, engineers) to determine the highest platform needs, and work to implement them. You’ll work on transaction similarity, entity recognition, and categorization models.
