Please include the reference code for this opportunity in your email.  For Technical information, contact Ryan Crumley at rcrumley@lanl.gov.  Certification:  I certify that I am at least 18 years of age and a US citizen, and am currently enrolled as a student in a degree seeking undergraduate or graduate program in a STEM field at an accredited Minority Serving Institution (MSI).  Application Deadline  2/28/2022 11:59:00 PM Eastern Time Zone Description  The Minority Serving Institutions Partnership Program (MSIPP) Internships is a new program to promote the education and development of the next generation workforce in critical science, engineering, technology, and math (STEM) related disciplines that complement current and future missions of DOE national laboratories. The MSIPP Internship program is designed to provide an enhanced training environment for next generation scientists and engineers by exposing them to research challenges unique to our industry.  MSIPP Interns will be given the opportunity to complete Summer Internships aligned with ongoing U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM) research under the direction of a host national laboratory. The internship will be performed at the host national laboratory, utilizing their facilities and equipment under the guidance of a research staff member.  Minority Serving Institutions are institutions of higher education enrolling populations with significant percentages of undergraduate minority students.  Project:  This research project will support ongoing, multi-institutional research on snowpack and hydrology in Alaskan watersheds. The student will participate in conjunction with NOAA, NCAR, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists to assimilate remotely-sensed datasets of snowpack characteristics (fractional snow covered area (fSCA) and snow water equivalence (SWE)) into the National Water Model (WRF-Hydro) workflow in order to improve our understanding of the timing and quantity of streamflow in various watersheds in Alaska. The student will get experience with reanalysis weather datasets, remotely-sensed snow datasets, and a land surface hydrology model. As snowpack is the largest driver of streamflow in Alaska, understanding and validating snowpack characteristics are strongly linked with infrastructure and hydroelectric development and maintenance in the State. Snow characteristics are also important in terms of the permafrost (frozen ground). Permafrost thaw can lead to release of carbon and methane, which will add to current greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and potentially feedback to increase global climate change. An effort will be made to include the student's contribution in future publications that develop from this research project.  Salary:  Selected candidate will be compensated by either a stipend or salary, and may include one round trip domestic travel to and from the host laboratory. Stipends and salaries will be commensurate with cost of living at the location of the host laboratory. Housing information will be provided to interns prior to arrival at the host laboratory, and will vary from lab to lab.  Qualifications  Eligible applicants must:  Be a citizen of the United States.  Be at least 18 years of age .  Currently enrolled as a full-time undergraduate or graduate student at an accredited Minority Serving Institution, https://orise.orau.gov/msipp/documents/approved-msi-school-list.pdf.
