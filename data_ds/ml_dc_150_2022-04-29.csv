Widespread adoption of existing energy-efficiency (EE) building technologies – and the introduction and use of new technologies – could eventually reduce energy use in homes and commercial buildings by 50 percent. This would save almost $200 billion annually on energy bills and help create jobs. BTO’s mission is to support research and development (R&D), validation, and integration of affordable, energy-saving technologies, strategies, analytical tools, and information services to enable industry and others to deploy these at scale to reduce energy use and cost in both new and existing residential and commercial buildings.  In addition to EE, Buildings Technologies Office (BTO) has several additional co-emphases. An important one is demand-flexibility (DF), a building’s ability to responsively shape its electricity draw at time scales ranging from multiple hours to seconds and even sub-seconds in order to support grid stability, reliability, and the efficient use of a variety of generation resources. Grid-interactive Efficient Buildings (GEB) is a cross-cutting BTO initiative aimed at establishing building-based DF as a key grid asset. Other emerging co-emphases include resilience, embodied energy, EE and DF at the neighborhood scale, and a new focus on technologies and strategies that support the building construction and deep renovation process; the latter is led by the Advanced Building Construction (ABC) initiative.  BTO’s Emerging Technologies (ET) Program aims to enable the development of cost-effective technologies that can reduce building energy use intensity by 45 percent by 2030, relative to 2010 EE technologies. The ET Program works towards this goal by supporting early-stage R&D in component technologies for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC&R) and water heating; solid-state lighting; and windows and opaque building envelope. The ET Program also has sub-programs in integration technology areas including Sensors and Controls (S&C).  Machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) are playing increasingly large roles in many sectors and are beginning to make an impact in buildings sectors as well with applications in building control, grid response, equipment and system-level fault detection and diagnostics, measurement and verification (M&V), demand forecasting, planning, and others. BTO’s ET Program seeks a talented and committed individual to help it enhance and expand its use of machine learning and data science throughout its portfolio.  Through this appointment, you will learn how to:  Participate in technical reviews/assessments of proposed research and development plans, conduct technical and economic feasibility analysis, as well as evaluate at a deep technical level the progress and ongoing viability and success potential of projects toward meeting the BTO energy efficiency goals. This includes periodic technical reviews and providing rigorous technical feedback for funded R&D projects; as well as collaborating in the negotiation of statements of work and project management plans with technically rigorous milestones, go/no-go decision points, stage-gates and deliverables for new awards.  Collaborate with BTO staff in the assessment of the state-of-the-art scientific literature and practice in machine learning and data science in building applications and in evaluating the potential of machine learning and data science in various building applications.  Collaborate with BTO staff in developing short, medium, and long term strategies and goals for the use of machine learning and data science in building applications.  Engage integration of BTO’s machine learning and data science activities with other efforts across EERE, DOE, and with external stakeholders.   Selected participants will receive a stipend as support for their living and other expenses during this appointment. Stipend rates are determined by EERE officials and are based on the candidate’s academic and professional background.

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=259f739a2df55e5f&from=web&vjs=3,280,Post-Doctoral Scientist,George Washington University,"Foggy Bottom, DC 20037","     The George Washington University School of Media & Public Affairs seeks exceptional candidates with a strong background in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for a full-time, academic research position at the rank of post-doctoral fellow. Beginning as early as fall 2019, the position is for a two-year term. The successful candidate will work with Dr. Rebekah Tromble and other researchers on an interdisciplinary, international research project examining the “health” of political conversations on Twitter.      Given the concerns about growing polarization, abuse, and harassment on Twitter, the project will develop four metrics to quantify the “health” of political conversations on the platform. Measures of (1) mutual recognition and (2) diversity of perspectives will examine and diagnose issues that arise when users isolate themselves from those holding differing opinions. Measures for (3) incivility and (4) intolerance will help assess the extent of anti-normative and antidemocratic discourse. In order to classify these measures at scale, the project draws upon computational approaches in NLP and network analysis, combining these with a firm grounding in social scientific theory, concepts, and empirics to better understand how these phenomena impact Twitter users. (Please note that the project is designed to measure these phenomena and their effects, not to flag and “take down” content considered potentially problematic.) The project offers a unique opportunity to work closely with faculty from different disciplines and to engage across academic, tech, and policy sectors in both the United States and Europe. The project is funded by Twitter, with knowledge exchange between academic researchers and the company. However, the research will be conducted independently and the findings distributed publicly.      Duties:          Design novel directions in machine learning and neural networks for the detection of discourse structures (e.g., turn-taking) and social constructs (e.g. empathy) in various languages.      Conduct standard data science tasks on large data sets (e.g., data wrangling).      Support other areas of the project research, including statistical analyses, as needed.      Along with the principal investigator (PI), co-supervise research assistants.      Perform other related duties as assigned. The omission of specific duties does not preclude the supervisor from assigning duties that are logically related to the position.     Minimum Qualifications:       Qualified candidates will hold a Doctoral degree or comparable doctoral degree in a related discipline. Degree must be conferred by the start date of the position.    Additional Required Licenses/Certifications/Posting Specific Minimum Qualifications: Preferred Qualifications:        Ph.D. in Computer Science, Computational Linguistics/NLP, Machine Learning, Statistics, Data Science, or related fields.      Excellent programming skills in Python. Additional languages (C++, R) are a plus.      Knowledge of current neural network models and implementation tools for neural networks (e.g. Dynet, Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, etc.).

In 2009, we created Robots & Pencils with the then-contrarian view that mobile would be more transformative than the Internet. Turns out we were right. Today, our thinking is rooted in the belief that, in the age of unprecedented technology acceleration, maintaining a competitive advantage requires new strategies and a focus on innovation. Our approach has been to create a company designed to follow the talent, allowing us to amass an unfair share of hyper-skilled people who call Robots & Pencils home. A team of people who not only develop innovative solutions to transform businesses, but also create products that have been previously inconceivable.   * Our Core Values: *      Strong Work Ethic    Top Drawer    Always Learning    Heart    Discipline    Efficacy    Together     * Robots & Pencils Offers: * We care about Talent.

Over the years we’ve hosted comedian shows, had holiday parties, happy hours, brunches with the CEO, surprise coffee runs for the team, health & wellness events and prizes, trivia nights, surprise dinners for R&P team members and their family and so much more! (And yes, we’ve prioritized a way to do these things in a virtual setting and not just in person - thank you Zoom!)     Job Description Are you a curious, adaptable, self-driven developer who demonstrates expertise by communicating your ideas clearly, and respectfully to those around you? Do you accept the ideas of others, and change your approach in the spirit of learning, and of shared principles, patterns, and practices?

https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=4332f36b772aa96f&from=web&vjs=3,450,Junior data scientist / bioinformatics,Data Tecnica,"Glen Echo, MD 20812","Data Tecnica Int’l + NIH/NINDS Open as of February 1st, 2021. Come join our collaborative team at Data Tecnica International (DTI) by supporting two great labs at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Stroke (NINDS, Ward and Levine labs). This opportunity focuses on aiding with data processing, management and analysis of dynamic cellular data in the contexts of both cellular and animal models. The minimal qualifications of the candidate is a US citizen (or work permit holder) with some experience in bioinformatics, high performance computing, python programming and a basic knowledge of genomics. Ideally, a master’s degree in bioinformatics, neural computation, computational biology or biomedical data science would be best. This position is open immediately. This position is remote for the duration of at least one year, commensurate with ~1300 hours of work estimated for the calendar year. Please see below for a comprehensive outline of potential duties, responsibilities and background on the collaborative labs. If interested, please send: CV, recommendation contact information and a GitHub link or other code example to info@datatecnica.com. Levine Lab Data Types : All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form. Mouse behavior Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc. Cellular activity (post-hoc): Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers Cellular activity (dynamic): Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the broader population of recorded cells Levine Lab Analysis Goals : Data analysis: Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar) Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position) Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions Recording from different populations of neurons Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types Different behavioral/motivational contexts Developmental age Spinal cord injury Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration Data Modeling: Physical forces/torques/biomechanics Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys) Dynamical systems modeling Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration Levine Lab SOW : Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing. The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative. Levine Lab Background : The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury. To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery. Ward Lab Data Types : Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint Ward Lab Analysis Goals : Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets. Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets) Ward Lab SOW Data analysis (as above) The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI) Ward Lab   Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI: Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible. Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions. Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI. Ward Lab background : The Ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We exclusively use genetically-modified human iPSCs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. iPSCs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. Almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.",30+ days ago,

From our earliest days, we pioneered the use of predictive modeling to individually personalize credit card offers, turning the entire industry on its head. As we’ve grown bigger, we’ve found more and more ways to use technology and face-to-face conversations to understand the human problems associated with money and finances. In the Consumer Bank, we’ve combined this human-centered approach with our heritage of data-driven decision making to design, build and test our way to truly enabling financial experiences. We’ve challenged ourselves to spend less time planning, more time doing, and, above all else, to see the world through the eyes of our customers as they work to understand and manage their money. Are you passionate about improving the way people interact with their money? Are you driven by the delight you bring to customers? Do you keep asking, “why,” until you hit the root? It’s common to fall in love with solutions, but have you ever fallen in love with the problem? Do you have an opinion on whether shipping is more important than perfection? Do you have a healthy dose of skepticism for the impossible? If you’re nodding your head, then we want you! As a Product Manager focusing on our Consumer Bank products, you’ll be joining a passionate team of product managers, designers, engineers, data scientists, and analysts working to redefine how millions of customers interact with their money. You might work on developing the next generation of our mobile UI. You might solve the gnarly problems presented by a fleet of ATMs. You might reimagine the digital tools in our branches and cafes. You might empower the entire business with better platforms. You might protect our customers from the bad guys. You might build machine learning models to solve problems we haven’t even discovered yet. One thing is for sure: you will dream and you will ship. On any given day in the Bank you’ll be: Empowered.

Pushing big change by asking bold questions; starting small, testing, and learning your way to something dramatically better Sharing openly. Telling stories that change the way people think about building products and solving problems, and that illustrate the power of what software can do to make them even better Connecting creatively. Jumpstarting a self-supporting community by sowing the right seeds, building the right tools, integrating the right off-the-shelf products and just plain elbow grease Succeeding strategically. Solving the right problem and holding on the wrong one. Here is what you will bring to the table: Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your crazy idea, or follow an email chain for weeks to find someone with an answer. Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. You dug up a hidden feature in an API that let you do something really cool or introduced a new routine that broke down silos led to better decisions. Passionate. You care about growing others and bringing them together around what’s possible. You’ve started meetup groups or taught General Assembly courses because you love enabling others. Communicator. You can communicate complex ideas clearly, your team knows their priorities and why they’re doing what they’re doing. Maybe you’re an introvert, or maybe you’re an extrovert, but nobody accuses you of keeping them out of the loop. Wrangler.
