As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has seen its valuation more than double since early 2020, reflecting the strength of our mobile-only marketplace and the value customers are deriving from our proprietary suite of fintech offerings.   Here are just a few stats that demonstrate our recent growth:   Hopper’s valuation is now over $3.5B, reflecting the strength of its mobile-only marketplace and value customers are deriving from the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.   Based on its current run rate, Hopper is pacing towards 330% revenue growth compared to last year, and it has already surpassed its pre-pandemic revenue peak from Q1 2020 by over 100%.   Hopper has over 60 million downloads, consistently ranks as one of the most downloaded travel apps, and now has a larger air travel market share in North America than it did before the pandemic (source: MIDT).   The company is on track to surpass $1.5 billion in travel sales this year, with 40% coming from the hotel and car rental categories.   Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent 50% of its revenue.   Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud , where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel fintech. The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.

The technology  is multi-patented, AI-powered, industry-shaping customer data management software that we invented because there was no way to solve the problems that we wanted to help consumer brands overcome.  The opportunity  is twofold: a market opportunity to provide a solution that consumer brands have been trying to find for decades, and a personal opportunity to grow and learn and hitch your career to a rocket ship.  Since our founding in 2016, Amperity has been growing 2.5X year-over-year. We've raised $187M in funding, including a recent Series D that increased our valuation to over one billion dollars. We're going places, fast, and we want you to come with us.  We help these brands make sense of massive amounts of transaction and engagement data so that they can finally know who their customers are, what opportunities exist, and how to provide the kinds of experiences that delight consumers and move the business metrics that matter. Our customers include Starbucks, Alaska Airlines, Patagonia, Kroger, J. Crew, Brooks Running, Planet Fitness, DICK's Sporting Goods, and many more.  We're building something that's never existed before, and we're doing it in a way that's great for consumers, transformational for our customers, and career-making for the members of the Amperity team. Come help us make it happen! The Team  The data science team at Amperity is a close-knit community of engineers and data scientists that move quickly and motivate each other to think independently, work autonomously, handle ambiguity, and solve hard problems. We identify, design and implement algorithms that lie at the heart of our products:   Identity matching: deduplicating and clustering billions of records to their underlying identities daily. Our customers use our predictions to analyze their customer base and create a personalized experience for their customers at every touchpoint.  Predictive modeling: With unified and enriched customer profiles (thanks to our identity matching pipeline), we build advanced customer-centric models to predict metrics/behaviors such as customer lifetime value, product recommendations, discount sensitivity, and event propensity.   In addition to algorithmic development, we value sharing our findings with the broader data science community. We publish our research in top-tier peer-reviewed publications, engage with fellow data scientists by speaking at internal and external conferences, and also hold several patents focused on our core IP (with many more to come).  We're looking for a Data Scientist to join our rapidly growing data science team to help develop predictive models and ML techniques that keep us at the forefront of predictive marketing analytics. Your work will be instrumental in developing new IP, improving the efficacy of existing models, and researching new methods as we continue to increase the surface area of our predictive modeling suite.  What You'll Do  Research and prototype models to extract insights from massive databases of customer interactions with brands across retail, hospitality, dining, and more  Be part of a team making deep investments in experimental design, statistical rigor, and model interpretability  Ensure our models can be reliably reproduced and integrated with a platform driving insights for dozens of leading brands  Develop IP in the form of patents, research papers, and conference presentations  Be part of an active (and fun) group of machine learning practitioners and data scientists distributed across New York and Seattle  About You  Undergraduate degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g. statistics, mathematics) with 2+ years of experience building out predictive models using advanced statistical or ML techniques in a production environment  You have the technical competence to perform advanced analytics: coding skills (such as Python, Java, or Scala), experience with analytics & visualization tools (Pandas, R, SPSS, SQL, Hadoop, Tableau), and experience performing analysis with large datasets  Prior research in an industry setting in one of the following areas: entity matching, probabilistic databases, or predictive marketing analytics  Significant expertise in a broad set of ML concepts ranging from regression to clustering, along with model prototyping, tuning, and evaluation  Ability to synthesize complex ideas for both technical and non-technical audiences. Good communication skills in conducting code reviews, writing technical documentation, and giving internal and external presentations.  Benefits  We offer all the benefits you'd expect from a great place to work: 100% employee healthcare coverage, transportation subsidies, a comfortable work environment with plenty of snacks, and other employee experience perks like events and activities, both in-person and remote. We also offer self-managed PTO and the flexibility to do your best work in the way that works for you.

For a complete description of our benefits for this position, please visit our website, click here.   As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.  UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.  The Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE; https://csde.washington.edu/) seeks an Applied Statistical Demographer to join its Scientific Core. CSDE is a population research center at the University of Washington funded by a P2C grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), matching funds from the College of Arts and Sciences, and faculty affiliate grant proposals. CSDE is uniquely situated at the UW to foster cutting-edge population science, including our partnership with the Northwest Federal Statistical Research Data Center (NWFSRDC), an active demographic graduate training program, and initiatives on campus linking and sharing administrative data and driving the formation of interdisciplinary teams together for scientific, evidence-based policymaking. To further foster scholastic connections, CSDE maintains active linkages with other research centers on campus, including the eScience Institute, the Center for Social Science Computation and Research (CSSCR), the Center for Statistics in the Social Sciences (CSSS), the West Coast Poverty Center, and the Population Health Initiative, among many others.  This position provides methodological support to faculty and graduate students studying demographic processes and their connections to environmental and health dynamics, as well as leadership on innovative new projects consistent with the scientific emphases of the center. It requires both broad social science research skills and an orientation towards service and facilitation of research. The successful candidate will provide data management, statistical consultation, programming, and general research support for Center researchers. We are especially interested in candidates with experience and interest in working with novel and complex data sources, including administrative data. Accordingly, this position requires exceptional interpersonal and communication skills; flexibility, adaptability and the desire to learn new skills as needed; and the ability to work as part of a team. We are looking for someone who is able to provide assistance to all levels of researchers and to do outreach that encourages best practice demographic research methods and successful grant proposals. These interpersonal skills are equally as important as the technical skills for this position.  In addition to research support functions, CSDE research staff are expected to develop their own area of expertise as well as peer networks within and outside of the UW. They participate significantly in research design and execution in collaboration with affiliate faculty, and serve substantial roles on sponsored projects. The Applied Statistical Demographer is expected to take a leadership role in identifying opportunities for, and development of, independent and collaborative research on topics consistent with the broad scientific goals of CSDE.  The Applied Statistical Demographer, if interested, may also participate in the leadership of the Northwest Federal Statistics Research Data Center (NWFSRDC). The NWFSRDC is a secure enclave where approved researchers can access highly confidential data collected by federal agencies. If a candidate has experience working in an FSRDC environment and has interest in providing leadership for CSDE around these kinds of research infrastructure and related research projects, they should indicate that interest in their application letter for this position.  Another role filled by the Applied Statistical Demographer is to serve as CSDE’s Training Director for CSDE’s Certificate Program in Demographic Methods. This interdisciplinary training program is open to any graduate student at UW and is well-subscribed and supported by a part time graduate program coordinator, CSDE’s Director and CSDE’s Training Core Principal Investigator. The Training Program Director would be responsible for operational supervision of the program coordinator, facilitation of outreach and recruitment, provision of mentoring and teaching for CSDE trainees (including teaching CSDE 502), management and oversight of CSDE’s technical workshops, and collaborating with the Training Core PI to assess and improve program quality and trainee progress.  The first year of the position is supported 100% by CSDE. Depending on the successful candidate’s interests in taking up leadership roles, CSDE may support their administrative leadership efforts from 50-70% effort with the remainder of their effort taken up with consultations and contributions to individual scientific projects (with full support from CSDE during their first year on the job). After the first year of this position, the Applied Statistical Demographer will be supported by CSDE at 50-70% of their FTE (depending on their administrative roles), and expected to generate 30-50% of their FTE through participation on collaborative grants or other funding sources. This model has worked well with existing staff, as it encourages outreach, professional growth, and exposure to new topic areas. This position is ideal for a talented person with a PhD seeking a challenging and rewarding non-faculty academic research position, which offers ongoing opportunities for professional development including conference travel, training, and co-authorship in publications.   RESPONSIBILITIES:   Identify opportunities for collaborative research and take a leadership role in all stages of the conceptualization of research topics, identification and development of appropriate data, design and execution of strategies to analyze these data, and dissemination of results to the scientific community with professional presentations and publications.  Support for the entire research cycle including study design and grant proposal writing; data collection, data management, data analysis, and data archiving; and manuscript writing and publication  Provide consulting in statistical analysis, research methodology, study design and implementation, and data management and archiving.
