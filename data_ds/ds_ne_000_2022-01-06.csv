The University of Nebraska at Omaha is fueled by its historical ties to Omaha. As the first municipal university in Omaha, the early founders’ goal was to make higher education accessible and affordable for the city’s residents. In 1968, the campus joined the University of Nebraska system, and today has the unique role of serving as the state’s metropolitan campus.  Accessibility remains a top priority in UNO’s mission and vision. Today, the campus is known for its student-centered environment, its community engagement, and its dedication to embracing students from all types of backgrounds. UNO’s ranking as the 2020 Best College for LGBTQ+ Students In Nebraska reflects a commitment to the Maverick values of access, inclusion and diversity that make UNO a welcoming campus community, evidenced by the numerous resources and support services offered by the university.  The campus has built strong partnerships with local business, education, government, arts, and civic organizations in the city. UNO’s commitment to community engagement has landed UNO on the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for seven consecutive years—the highest federal recognition a school can receive for civic engagement.  This honor is but one of many points of pride for UNO. In 2019, it was ranked in the top ten public institutions in the nation for military friendliness by Military Times magazine for the fifth consecutive year. Nearly 90 percent of UNO’s 15,500 students are from Nebraska, and roughly 60 percent of recent alumni surveyed report graduating with no debt or less than $5,000 in debt. It is simply one of the most competitively priced institutions in the region. UNO, while large enough to provide students with global opportunities, thrives on its personal and close-knit campus culture, where students come first and partnerships with the community grow every day.
