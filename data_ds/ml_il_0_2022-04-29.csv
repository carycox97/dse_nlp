The flagship software - SZ has been verified as one of the best error-bonded lossy compressors in the community by many domain scientists independently. Joining SZ team will have exceptional opportunities to collaborate with top-tier scientists in different domains and use cutting-edge supercomputers (Aurora, Summit, etc.).        Today's scientific applications are producing extremely large volumes of data, which are causing serious issues including storage burden, I/O bottlenecks, communication bottlenecks, and insufficient memory. Error-controlled lossy compression has been recognized as one of the most efficient solutions to resolve the big scientific data issue. Existing state-of-the-art lossy compressors, however, are all developed based on fixed/static compression models or pipeline, which cannot adapt to diverse data characteristics and sophisticated user-requirements. In this project, we will develop a scalable dynamic data reduction framework, which can optimize lossy compression for various use-cases dynamically and efficiently.        The key techniques include using ML/DL to explore the diverse correlations of high-dimensional science datasets, using ML/DL to identify the best-qualified data compression model dynamically, using ML/DL to optimize the parameter configurations of various compression methods, using ML/DL to denoise datasets and/or recovering missing features for reconstructed data.

Argonne employees, and certain guest researchers and contractors, are subject to particular restrictions related to participation in Foreign Government Sponsored or Affiliated Activities, as defined and detailed in United States Department of Energy Order 486.1A. You will be asked to disclose any such participation in the application phase for review by Argonne's Legal Department.                                                                                                                                                                            All Argonne offers of employment are contingent upon a background check that includes an assessment of criminal conviction history conducted on an individualized and case-by-case basis. Please be advised that Argonne positions require upon hire (or may require in the future) for the individual be to obtain a government access authorization that involves additional background check requirements.

Argonne employees, and certain guest researchers and contractors, are subject to particular restrictions related to participation in Foreign Government Sponsored or Affiliated Activities, as defined and detailed in United States Department of Energy Order 486.1A. You will be asked to disclose any such participation in the application phase for review by Argonne's Legal Department.                                                                                                                                                                            All Argonne offers of employment are contingent upon a background check that includes an assessment of criminal conviction history conducted on an individualized and case-by-case basis. Please be advised that Argonne positions require upon hire (or may require in the future) for the individual be to obtain a government access authorization that involves additional background check requirements. Failure to obtain or maintain such government access authorization could result in the withdrawal of a job offer or future termination of employment.

Argonne employees, and certain guest researchers and contractors, are subject to particular restrictions related to participation in Foreign Government Sponsored or Affiliated Activities, as defined and detailed in United States Department of Energy Order 486.1A. You will be asked to disclose any such participation in the application phase for review by Argonne's Legal Department.                                                                                                                                                                            All Argonne offers of employment are contingent upon a background check that includes an assessment of criminal conviction history conducted on an individualized and case-by-case basis. Please be advised that Argonne positions require upon hire (or may require in the future) for the individual be to obtain a government access authorization that involves additional background check requirements.

The incumbent will be a key contributor in a multidisciplinary co - design team that spans materials, circuits, and system - level with the goal of revolutionizing capability for high - energy physics (HEP) and nuclear physics (NP) detectors and associated science. Th e Postdoc will work with leading scientists to create models at circuit/network, spiking neural networks, and computing system levels. The role includes participation and dissemination of research results at scientific conferences.        The position is in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division (MCS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Argonne is a US Department of Energy Laboratory with world class research in materials, devic es, and computing.        The MCS Division includes experts across computer science, applied math, data science and learning, and computational science. The laboratory is the home of a DOE Leadership Computing Facility which will be home to an exascale computi ng system, and is already equipped with cutting edge machine - learning accelerators such as Cerebras CS - 1, Sambanova, Nvidia DGX - A100, and many other advanced computing systems. MCS has active collaborations with over a dozen top computer science department s in the US and around the world.        Postdoctoral appointees will be fully integrated in the large research community in the MCS Division (more than 100 scientists and postdocs) and have the opportunity to collaborate with leaders in the field. This project involves collaboration with two divisions, one of which is the Materials Science Division (MSD) that includes research on superconducting and magnetic materials, quantum metamaterials, ferroelectrics, correlated oxides and catalytic materials, along with n ew thrusts in topological materials and electrochemical oxides. The second is the High Energy Physics Division (HEP) that have contributed to the deep understanding of the natural world and have built some of the world’s largest, most complex and sophisti cated devices, including powerful accelerators, massive particle detectors and sensitive cosmological survey instruments.        Position Requirements        Required skills include experience with computational modeling of device and circuits and analysis of computer systems performance. Skills or experience with neuromorphic computing/spiking neural networks and either physics - based device models or compu ter architecture is highly desirable. Familiarity with parallel or high - performance computing and Linux - based systems are all a plus.        Candidates must have a PhD (typically completed within the last 3 years, or soon-to-be completed) in Electrical or Computer Engineering, or a closely related discipline or equivalent experience.

Argonne employees, and certain guest researchers and contractors, are subject to particular restrictions related to participation in Foreign Government Sponsored or Affiliated Activities, as defined and detailed in United States Department of Energy Order 486.1A. You will be asked to disclose any such participation in the application phase for review by Argonne's Legal Department.                                                                                                                                                                            All Argonne offers of employment are contingent upon a background check that includes an assessment of criminal conviction history conducted on an individualized and case-by-case basis. Please be advised that Argonne positions require upon hire (or may require in the future) for the individual be to obtain a government access authorization that involves additional background check requirements.

Argonne employees, and certain guest researchers and contractors, are subject to particular restrictions related to participation in Foreign Government Sponsored or Affiliated Activities, as defined and detailed in United States Department of Energy Order 486.1A. You will be asked to disclose any such participation in the application phase for review by Argonne's Legal Department.                                                                                                                                                                            All Argonne offers of employment are contingent upon a background check that includes an assessment of criminal conviction history conducted on an individualized and case-by-case basis. Please be advised that Argonne positions require upon hire (or may require in the future) for the individual be to obtain a government access authorization that involves additional background check requirements.

Argonne employees, and certain guest researchers and contractors, are subject to particular restrictions related to participation in Foreign Government Sponsored or Affiliated Activities, as defined and detailed in United States Department of Energy Order 486.1A. You will be asked to disclose any such participation in the application phase for review by Argonne's Legal Department.                                                                                                                                                                            All Argonne offers of employment are contingent upon a background check that includes an assessment of criminal conviction history conducted on an individualized and case-by-case basis. Please be advised that Argonne positions require upon hire (or may require in the future) for the individual be to obtain a government access authorization that involves additional background check requirements.
