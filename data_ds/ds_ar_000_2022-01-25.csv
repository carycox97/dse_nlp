The Imaging Data Scientist is part of a dynamic team of researchers, scientists, and clinicians that engage with clinical trials operations, translational research initiatives, and research collaborators in academia, government and the pharmaceutical industry. The goals are to identify tissue biomarkers of immunologic mechanisms underlying clinical outcomes in human kidney transplantation, and to advance these imaging-based technologies toward clinical applications. The Imaging Data Scientist reports to the Director of the MIC and works shoulder to shoulder with the Multiplex Imaging Research Scientist in the MIC to process high dimensional digital images of tissue sections to quantitative data sets and performs downstream computational and spatial statistical analysis. In addition, the Imaging Data Scientist will have a background in data engineering that well-serves interaction between the MIC’s research enterprise and the company’s Information Technology department, advising and collaborating on best approaches toward innovation in data management.   ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS The incumbent’s primary roles are (i) to process and analyze digital images of tissues using commercially available platforms (eg. Halo, VisioPharm, SciLS, etc.); and (ii) to visualize and perform computational and statistical analysis of the resulting large datasets using languages such as R, Python, C++, Java and/or MATLAB. The incumbent will prepare presentations of results for internal meetings and public dissemination in the forms of posters, talks and papers. Given the volume of data generated and managed in this role, close interaction with IT will be necessary, and the incumbent will be well-served by a background in data engineering.
