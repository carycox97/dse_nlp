Are you interested in joining a startup early enough to really innovate while building on a wave of already proven success? Would you like to be part of an AI movement seeking independence from big toy workbenches and cloud roadmap promises?  What You Will Do  As a  QA Engineer  on our team, you will be creating test cases to validate acceptance criteria for new features, executing them manually or automating them as regression candidates. You will help manage independent test batteries designated for different stages of the development lifecycle, and to leverage configuration management tools to emulate environments for regression of new versions and patches. You will also partner with data scientists to understand the typical business performance metrics and service level objectives commonly established for different types of algorithms, helping to create synthetic data sets to thoroughly test advanced model performance metrics, and to validate our methods for ensuring the quality, reliability, and accurate detection of model degradation.  What Would Help Us   Someone with 3 to 5 years of full-time test automation with primary focus on Python or JavaScript  Insight into how blackbox, smoke, and integration cases combine to provide effective coverage  Being able to understand and manage your own infrastructure to rule out environmental false positives  Ability to quickly grasp functional changes and come up with a corresponding set of test cases  Testing of multi-tenant applications and other SaaS considerations  Ability to validate test results by gathering data from tables and logs with automation  Some familiarity with validating data quality, testing ETL processes, and other data engineering  Of course, experience with ML or testing ML-based applications is great, but not required   What We Offer   A culture of growth with the room to learn  Medical/dental/vision insurance plans  Unlimited PTO  100% remote work options  A talented team around you equally committed to success  Gym reimbursement  401k   About Us  At Datatron, we create technology for the growing number of companies recognizing the need to ensure  reliable  machine learning as part of their operations, aiding them with the implications of making their proliferating models  available  and  observable . We don't believe only proprietary software or public clouds should make this possible, nor should they dictate what metrics are available to evaluate model effectiveness. We provide customers with their own distributable version of our Kubernetes, Python and React developed platform, and with this, they achieve well-governed model ops, making it easy to catalog, validate, deploy, scale, and continually measure performance for degradation or error...all agnostic to what the model was built with. As the world becomes more reliant on AI to make decisions and draw conclusions, we fill a critical and widening gap today between the models that customers build and train, and the versions that end up fitting their business expectations, while also providing the means to continually assess that they are remaining reliable.  We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity very highly at our company. For us, diversity is the true key to innovation and everyone in the Datatron family is equally embraced for their unique perspective and experiences. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

For more details, read on!  About the Company:  We all waste a staggering amount of time (~33%) because we have no idea where we are spending it. Worse yet, we continue to operate in a factory model that simply does not apply to creative work. Our big bet is that by understanding time, we'll be able to move away from it as a unit of value. In the future knowledge economy (lawyers, accountants, engineers), contributions will be assessed on value added, not the underlying time spent adding it.  Ambitious mission to say the least, so where are we starting? We have created a new market category called  Time Automation  that automates the timekeeping process for professionals and allows us to collect time data at scale. Before TBP, professionals had to manually record every six minutes of their day into antiquated timekeeping software. Not anymore.  We are a Series B company (>$55M in venture capital from Tier 1 funds) that has assembled some of the best builders, designers, and product minds in tech—and we all have one thing in common: we are deeply motivated by our mission  to return time .  We need to find like-minded colleagues who want to join us on our journey and are willing to spend their time solving time. It will be a long road but if we're even half right, we'll change the way work is measured and performed forever.  About the Role:  Come lead our Product Automation Strategy and use of ML to return human time as our Director of Engineering for Machine Learning. This role is responsible for creating a system that fundamentally understands how people work, then applying this the problem we are solving today of shortening the time users spend converting work activities into timesheets to deliver on our promise to help timekeepers bill more time,  in   less time.  While we build out our burgeoning ML group, this role requires you to develop short and mid term strategy, recruiting of a world class engineering team, and relentless product execution by bringing real-world use of machine learning and coupling it in a consumer-grade software experience for enterprise customers.  As the first leadership hire dedicated to this core company function, you will set the culture and approach — boldly differentiating us from our competition and stirring the imagination of the many customers we serve and will serve tomorrow on the possibilities of Time Automation for their industries (yes, beyond legal).  You will be responsible for a full stack team that will include the data storage and processing infrastructure, the cleansing and analysis of the data, model creation and delivery, integration of those models into backend services and the presentation layer, and regular feedback telemetry monitoring for in-field performance. You will be broadly empowered to make both the technology selections and engineering process decisions to optimally deliver.  Core Duties:  Build, own, and drive our Automation strategy and technology, and in particular our Machine Learning and other Predictive Services work to help minimize time and effort for timesheet creation.  Collaborate with the Design team to create a design language that helps our users understand how TBP works for them, demystifying the automation.  Lead our Engineering efforts to develop a world class infrastructure and pipeline for data, machine learning, and model management that allows us to improve the product at blistering speed (model creation, management, and deployment).  Deliver regular releases of models and service releases to improve the products automation capabilities.  Collaborate with Sales, Product Marketing, and Customer Success so they effectively speak to our automation capabilities for their stakeholders, driving product sales and adoption.

Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act. Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface. We’re looking for a thoughtful, data-savvy, and product-focused designer to join our growing team. In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to drive the visual and interaction identity of Sisu, as well as design and launch a wide range of product experiences from concept to implementation.

What you'll accomplish: Refine and implement Sisu’s look and feel in the product Design and ship business-critical, user-centric, data-oriented product experiences Create storyboards, wireframes, and prototypes to communicate your ideas to the team Work cross-functionally with product, engineering, and sales to identify and prioritize customer needs Elevate design thinking and culture at Sisu, as part of our small, but growing design team  What you'll need to be successful: A strong sense of design fundamentals, including iconography, typography, color, and data visualization Creativity, persistence, and inquisitiveness about analytics, BI, and enterprise data, and the desire to help businesses solve problems in new ways A track record of designing and building rich, accessible desktop experiences Ability to design and iterate quickly and efficiently in a dynamic setting Comfort tackling ambiguous problem spaces and ability to bring clarity through problem definition, scoping, and prioritization for design Prior experience conducting customer research of any type and ability to synthesize qualitative feedback with data to guide design decisions Experience teaming up with engineers and designers to build and ship products Familiarity with design tools, such as Figma, Sketch, and Principle  Nice to have: Prior experience building enterprise or data-oriented products Prior experience with data visualization  For a product designer,  there’s no better environment to advance your career, develop your skills, and make an impact along the way. As you mature in this role, you’ll have the chance to work with global leaders, learn from industry mavericks, and help build an amazing, eclectic, and supportive organization.
