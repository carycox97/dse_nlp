Would it include a mission that truly justified the word ""mission?"" Would it involve being part of one of the best scientific research and production labs in the world creating petabytes of insight-rich data? Would it be a place filled with smart people all trying to help you do the best work of your career? Would it have leadership that could see an almost science fiction-like future and was looking to you to get there?  Recursion is the clinical-stage biotechnology company industrializing drug discovery by decoding biology. Recursion leverages sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to distill from its dataset the Recursion Map, a collection of hundreds of billions of searchable inferences across biology and chemistry unconstrained by human bias.  Recursion has been purpose-built to do things that have quite literally never been done before. And while we have resources and an amazing lab, the secret sauce is our people. They are the ones who make big bets and deal in orders of magnitude instead of thinking incrementally, and the result is clear: Eight years ago, we were doing plate manufacturing by hand. Today, we are able to process and scan more than a million experiments every week.  You'll be joining Recursion at an interesting time, both for the company and for the world. The global pandemic has reinforced in everyone's mind not only the importance of therapeutics, but also the critical value that accelerating every phase of drug discovery can provide. For most, the notion that ""patients can't wait"" is abstract; COVID-19 has made this concept all too real for millions, even billions, worldwide. Every week, you'll work hand-in-glove with our data and science teams, turning 1.8 million+ weekly automated experiments into a map of human biology.  It is an audacious goal, but it isn't a dream or science fiction. We're already doing it.  The Impact You'll Make  As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer, you will be building a platform that accelerates drug discovery with machine learning. By leveraging your experience in machine learning, software engineering, infrastructure, and data, you will:   Partner with peers, product, and customers across organizational and functional boundaries to discover, automate, and streamline ML workflows with a mixture of off-the-shelf and custom tooling as needed  Transfer research ideas into production and improve the efficiency of our models  Design, build and improve the infrastructure and abstractions to support our evolving research needs  Deploy, monitor, and optimize DL models in a continuous-use, high-throughput, biological research platform that executes millions of custom cellular experiments weekly  Steer the direction for ML tooling, improve technical standard and advocate for best practices  Inspire your team and stakeholders alike to find the best outcome by facilitating constructive dialogue, reconciling perspectives into a unified view   The Team You'll Join  Recursion has built a unique dataset (over 1 million unique biological perturbations profiled in a high-dimensional biological assay, making up nearly 13 PB of highly-relatable data) and a unique approach to phenotypic drug discovery using our inference-based Recursion Map to predict tens of billions of relationships between disease models and therapeutic candidates.  You will join a team of software and machine learning engineers working to standardize and automate the process of training, evaluating, and deploying deep learning models. We are expanding the ML applications we support and maximizing the use of our supercomputer. The capabilities you provide to machine learning scientists will allow them to have increased understanding of our models and move them into production with confidence.  The Experience You'll Need   Experience with statistical modeling and/or designing and building large distributed systems with elegant interfaces that can scale easily  Proficient in the full lifecycle of ML and software development in production, including: Data preparation & validation, model training, evaluation, validation, and monitoring  Optimizing, releasing, and maintaining ML products  Authoring well tested, easily maintained, scalable, documented code, peer reviews, CI/CD  Ability to own projects in a collaborative open environment  A mentor, coach, and sponsor to peers and colleagues  Nice to haves: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Horovod, GCP, Hybrid Cloud, Linux, CUDA, Docker, Kubernetes, BigQuery   #LI-BW1 The Values That We Hope You Share:   We Care:  We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.  We Learn:  Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.  We Deliver:  We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.  Act Boldly with Integrity:  No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.  We are One Recursion:  We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.   Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren't static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here.  Recursion requires all employees to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to their first date of employment.  More About Recursion  Central to our mission is the Recursion Operating System, or Recursion OS, that combines an advanced infrastructure layer to generate what we believe is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing proprietary biological and chemical datasets and the Recursion Map, a suite of custom software, algorithms, and machine learning tools that we use to explore foundational biology unconstrained by human bias and navigate to new biological insights which may accelerate our programs.

Want to work with it?  When combined with the right algorithms, data can do amazing things: it can encourage strangers to buy something or to click an ad, it can suggest a video or what word might want to use next. Those problems are clearly challenging and interesting, but why not use data science to tackle problems that have plagued humanity for generations: to revolutionize how we recognize and treat disease to directly improve lives and reduce suffering?  Wouldn't that be a career you could be proud of?  Recursion is the clinical-stage biotechnology company industrializing drug discovery by decoding biology. Recursion leverages sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to distill from its dataset the Recursion Map, a collection of hundreds of billions of searchable inferences across biology and chemistry unconstrained by human bias. As a data scientist at Recursion, you can make an even greater impact on human health and impact more lives than physicians treating one patient at a time. Data scientists at Recursion do science: from designing well-controlled experiments to building models and interpreting results, your skill and expertise can help us infer new compounds and treatments for diseases impacting people around the world.  Beyond the obvious impact you could make, Recursion is designed for data scientists. You will be a part of a team of 30+ data scientists managing 13 petabytes of data, all generated internally and to our specifications' specifications in an automated lab mere feet from where you work. Beyond scale, the secret sauce is that the data lives as a relatable dataset, fit-for-purpose directly answering complex experimental research questions.  You'll be joining Recursion at an interesting time, both for the company and for the world. The global pandemic has reinforced in everyone's mind not only the importance of therapeutics, but also the critical value that accelerating every phase of drug discovery can provide. For most, the notion that ""patients can't wait"" is abstract; COVID-19 has made this concept all too real for millions, even billions, worldwide. Every week, you'll work hand-in-glove with our science teams, turning +1.5 million weekly automated experiments into a map of human biology.  It is an audacious goal, but it isn't a dream or science fiction. It's something we're already doing.  The Impact You'll Make  With treatments for hundreds of diseases in our sights, we've built a data science team with domain expertise in computer science, bioinformatics, physics, biology, mathematics, applied statistics, and more. We work side-by-side with biologists, automation scientists, chemists, software engineers, and many others; together, we develop the tools and methods to turn our experimental data into treatments for pathologies that affect the lives of countless individuals.  In this role, you will be a computational and analytical expert who develops scalable solutions that impact our drug discovery pipeline.   Strategize  in collaboration with biologists, engineers, and data/ML scientists on the next steps for industrializing various stages of the drug discovery process.  Explore  novel metrics, analyses, or models to answer unresolved biological questions about our data generation processes or downstream applications.  Deliver  scalable software tools for the evaluation and communication of data generated by Recursion's high-dimensional, high-throughput assay platform.   The Team You'll Join  You will be joining a fast-growing, cross-functional team with expertise in biology, automation engineering, data science, software engineering, and product development. You can expect to be challenged with new scientific domains, high expectations for analytical software development, unresolved questions about analytical methods and applications, and ambitious goals to industrialize various aspects of the drug discovery process. Specifically, your team will focus on developing and scaling cellular models of disease for use in a wide range of research programs. A bold, creative, collaborative, growth-oriented, and team-first mindset will be critical to the success of both individuals and teams in this exceptionally challenging and exciting industry.  The Experience You'll Need   A firm grasp of probability, statistics, and machine learning.  High fluency with the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc).  Experience with collaborative software development and peer code review, including version control tools like git.  Experience developing, releasing, and maintaining software in a continuous-use production environment.  A track record of outstanding past projects, product development, publications, or presentations.  Experience communicating complex concepts and methods to audiences with diverse technical backgrounds. Preferred: experience generating and analyzing biological datasets Leveling   2+ years experience in an industry setting, or post-baccalaureate experience in a related scientific or engineering field developing data science methods or tools, or equivalent experience in the application of ML and analytical tools in postdoctoral work.  Senior and Staff levels may be considered for candidates with commensurate experience, a record of product development in domains directly relevant to Recursion's platform, and/or experience as a technical lead driving execution in these areas.   #LI-EP1 The Values That We Hope You Share:   We Care:  We care about our drug candidates, our Recursionauts, their families, each other, our communities, the patients we aim to serve and their loved ones. We also care about our work.  We Learn:  Learning from the diverse perspectives of our fellow Recursionauts, and from failure, is an essential part of how we make progress.  We Deliver:  We are unapologetic that our expectations for delivery are extraordinarily high. There is urgency to our existence: we sprint at maximum engagement, making time and space to recover.  Act Boldly with Integrity:  No company changes the world or reinvents an industry without being bold. It must be balanced; not by timidity, but by doing the right thing even when no one is looking.  We are One Recursion:  We operate with a 'company first, team second' mentality. Our success comes from working as one interdisciplinary team.   Recursion spends time and energy connecting every aspect of work to these values. They aren't static, but regularly discussed and questioned because we make decisions rooted in those values in our day-to-day work. You can read more about our values and how we live them every day here.  Recursion requires all employees to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to their first date of employment.  More About Recursion  Central to our mission is the Recursion Operating System, or Recursion OS, that combines an advanced infrastructure layer to generate what we believe is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing proprietary biological and chemical datasets and the Recursion Map, a suite of custom software, algorithms, and machine learning tools that we use to explore foundational biology unconstrained by human bias and navigate to new biological insights which may accelerate our programs.
