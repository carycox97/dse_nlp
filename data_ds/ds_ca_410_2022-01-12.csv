https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=48d173b06bccab63&from=web&vjs=3,420,"Associate Director, Undergraduate Program in Data Science & Social Systems",Stanford University,"Stanford, CA","Stanford is launching a new undergraduate major in Data Science & Social Systems, designed for students who want to work at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences. Students in the program will develop a rigorous understanding of methods and approaches from computer science and statistics, alongside knowledge in area domains from the social sciences through a set of core courses. They will learn to apply technical tools to address substantive problems in areas such as public policy, sociology, political science, psychology and economics. Students will develop multiple fluencies: in computational methods, in domain knowledge and applications of social science broadly, and in the moral and political frameworks that shape social systems and illuminate the value trade-offs that are an inevitable part of social decision making. The degree is intended to prepare students for work in a range of industries that require integrating quantitative thinking with an understanding of human behavior or public policy and for careers in the public and social sectors where data-intensive approaches are increasingly prized. We are building out the leadership team of the new program now, as we prepare for its official launch in Fall 2022.  The degree is closely tied to a major new university initiative, Stanford Impact Labs, which is developing a new model of R&D for impact-focused social science.
