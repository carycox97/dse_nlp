You sleep, eat, and breath Excel and R, but are tired of working task lists in a slow-moving corporation. You enjoy the process of discovering new data challenges, and want the freedom to create meaningful solutions in real-time. You are constantly learning, teaching yourself new disciplines, and you are obsessed with the potential uses of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. You want the autonomy and responsibility that comes with being the company’s go-to resource for all-things data. In this role, you will translate complex business challenges into data tasks – our managers and clients know what’s wrong, and it is up to you to investigate in the data, determine the cause, and devise an elegant solution. You will continually refine your models to learn from increasing amounts of available information. You will decide what data points should be silently corrected, vs. highlighted with intuitive suggestions. This suggestion engine will be the foundation of the company’s core product. As the quality of data improve, your role will increasingly shift towards predictive analytics – using platform data to drive the high-level business strategies of our clients. You’ll be a skills fit if you: have 5+ years of experience using R, Python, Excel VBA, Apache Spark, Eclipse Deeplearning4j, and similar libraries have significant experience using AI toolkits such as TensorFlow, Pylearn2, and Pattern have significant experience building and training models using web services such as Amazon Rekognition, IBM Watson, and Google CloudVision have experience with image recognition, and image content identification routinely identify high-value data issues, explain their business impact to senior executives, and devise an elegant solution to the problem You’ll be a character fit if you: enjoy the challenges and rewards of working in a *very* early stage startup (very strong preference for someone who has worked in a <50-person company). are constantly tinkering (we love tinkerers!). enjoy challenging the status quo, and constantly come to your team with ideas for improvement. know when to check in for approval vs. run with an idea. view working for a large corporation as the death of productivity, innovation, intellectual stimulation, education, and pretty much any other goal of a company/job. do not sit idle once a task is complete – you have a constant backlog of tasks, or things you want to learn. have worked in a variety of team environments – distributed, remote, off-shore, near-shore, etc. think that TCP/IP is one of the most under-appreciated accomplishments of modern computing. want to create (and I really mean *create*) a fun, hard-working environment of peers with whom you’re excited to slay the day. don’t get wrapped up in titles, and chip in on things that need doing without asking (even if they have absolutely nothing to do with your responsibilities). What you get: Outstanding benefits, including fully-paid health insurance, 401k, commuter benefits, generous vacation, BYOD compensation, etc. Flexible work environment – e.g. working from home, shifted hours, etc. Potentially, equity shares in the company, depending on your experience The unique experience, pride and status that comes from being one of the first employees of a software startup The opportunity to build your own team as we expand, and shape the entire company/product The opportunity to “do it right” this time. We have all inherited someone else’s mess at some point, and wished we could build something from scratch to meet our own impeccable standards. It’s time to seize the opportunity.
