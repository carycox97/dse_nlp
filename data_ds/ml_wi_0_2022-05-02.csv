https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=08ee5e5b18788ed0&from=web&vjs=3,40,Postdoctoral Fellow,Medical College of Wisconsin,"Milwaukee, WI 53226","           We are seeking a post-doctoral fellow to join our vibrant community of researchers in the Language Imaging and Cognition and Brain Stimulation labs at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, United States). Our group investigates the neural correlates of human language processing in healthy and neurologically impaired populations (post-stroke aphasia, dyslexia, epilepsy) using behavioral, neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG), electrophysiological, and transcranial electrical (tES) and magnetic (TMS) stimulation methods.      The fellow will work on projects involving neuromodulation, neuroimaging, and electrophysiology to probe semantic and phonological processes in healthy individuals and in stroke survivors with aphasia. Projects involving concurrent applications of tES with EEG, and pre/post applications of tES with MEG are currently underway. Existing MEG and fMRI data, collected as part of the Epilepsy Connectome Project, are available, if there is interest in pursuing a new research question, or a new type of analysis.      The successful candidate will have a doctoral degree in cognitive neuroscience, biomedical engineering, computer science, psychology, cognitive science, or a related scientific area. A clear interest in language neuroscience research should be demonstrated. Experience working with neurologically impaired participants, EEG, MEG, and/or fMRI is desired.          Faculty:      Jeffrey Binder, MD  Neurologist & Cognitive Neuroscientist      Research focuses on neural systems underlying human language processing and concept representation, speech perception, reading, and aphasia. Much of this work is based on fMRI measurements in healthy people, combined with psycholinguistic and psychophysical measurements of behavior.          Priyanka Shah-Basak, PhD  Biomedical Engineer & Cognitive Neuroscientist      Research focuses on optimizing neurorehabilitation approaches for the treatment of aphasia, using noninvasive brain stimulation, electrophysiology (MEG and EEG) and structural and functional MRI, combined with neuropsychological testing and univariate and multivariate statistical approaches.          Lisa Conant, PhD  Neuropsychologist & Cognitive Neuroscientist      Research uses behavioral, functional neuroimaging, and advanced statistical methods to investigate the neural systems subserving phoneme perception, reading, and concept representation, as well as the cognitive and neural correlates of dyslexia and epilepsy.          Leonardo Fernandino, PhD  Cognitive Neuroscientist      Research investigates the neural mechanisms of language processing and semantic memory. Functional brain imaging and behavioral assessment of neurological patients and healthy participants are used to understand how these processes are implemented in the brain. One area of focus is the application of machine learning techniques to fMRI and MEG data to investigate how word meaning (i.e., lexical concepts) relate to the sensory and motor processes through which the brain interacts with the world.          Bill Gross, MD, PhD  Anesthesiologist and Cognitive Neuroscientist      Research is focused on understanding the neural underpinnings of language and developing translational applications to patients. Current projects include mapping the language system with fMRI to plan neurosurgical resections, exploring language networks using electrocorticography during awake craniotomies, and developing machine learning models to decode conceptual representations from brain activity.          Sara Pillay, PhD  Neuropsychologist      Specializes in understanding language reorganization after stroke in patients with aphasia using neuropsychological data, neuroimaging, and electrical stimulation techniques. In addition, she has interest in developing and testing language paradigms for use during intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping and electrocorticography.          It is expected that postdocs at MCW, with the assistance of their supervisor, will:           Transition to career independence through the development of professional skills that enable the postdoc to actively pursue a career of his/her own choosing.       Be supervised by at least one senior scholar who actively promotes the postdoc's professional development.       Establish an individual development plan (IDP) that incorporates equally the postdoc's career and training goals and the mentor's research goals.       Pursue basic, clinical, or translational projects so long as effort is focused primarily on research.       Publish results of the postdoc's research and scholarship during their appointment.       The postdoctoral appointment is temporary by nature, the aggregate amount of time spent as a postdoc is recommended to not exceed five years (not including family medical leave or maternity/paternity leave).       As postdocs are important members of the host institution's community, appropriate levels of compensation, health care, and other benefits commensurate with their essential status should be afforded, independent of the postdoc's source of funding.
