After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.   Job Description The Conversations team at Square builds Square Assistant - a virtual assistant to help merchants serve their customers. This can mean full automation of common tasks (e.g., booking and rescheduling appointments), but can also mean tools to make sellers more efficient and professional when messaging their customers. For example, suggesting polite and contextually relevant quick replies in response to a customer message. Looking to the future, the team is working to incorporate more skills into Assistant – e.g., order management and package tracking – and expanding our suggested replies to include suggested actions for the merchant to take in response to a customer message . The team itself was created in mid-2019 with the acquisition of Eloquent Labs. We're looking for senior NLP engineers and research scientists, particularly those with an interest in dialog systems and large-scale language models.   Qualifications You will... Play a key role in designing and developing novel dialog systems within Square, whether on the modeling side or the dialogue state management side. Build AI systems that will handle millions of conversations Collaborate with Backend, iOS, and web engineers to ship features. Work cross collaboratively with product managers and designers to iterate on and define product scope and design. Ship cutting-edge AI to businesses that traditionally haven’t had access to it You have… Experience in natural language processing and deep learning Experience with Java (for the dialogue state manager) and Python (for our deep learning models) Experience with PyTorch is strongly recommended Interest in helping to shape the mission and roadmap of a new team, and rallying others to join you Eagerness to share your own ideas, and openness to those of others Additional Information We’re working to build a more inclusive economy where our customers have equal access to opportunity, and we strive to live by these same values in building our workplace.
