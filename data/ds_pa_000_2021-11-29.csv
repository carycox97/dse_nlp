The type of problems we solve at SIG are often different from the subject of your PhD thesis, but nonetheless, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding. The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea: This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria. As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming. Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal. You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production. Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance. As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas. Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.  What we're looking for  PhD degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably Experience working on in-depth research projects Finance experience is a plus, but not required By applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Strategist position.

These programs rely on a financial modeling system called risk adjustment, wherein a mathematical value based on the conditions each patient has is used to calculate the overall cost to fund care for all enrollees. At Health Fidelity, we help health plans (payers) and hospitals (providers) who participate in these programs to accurately identify, assess, manage, and document the healthcare issues of a covered population (and therefore the risk) in order to provide clear visibility into, and compliant control over, the reimbursement process.

By doing so, we uncover actionable patient insights that are delivered via efficient workflows where they can be applied to greatest effect. This allows our partners to ensure appropriate reimbursement for care provided and drive deeper care for patients going forward, equipping them to better succeed in value-based care.  The volume of healthcare data is only expanding, so with it expands the need for, and capabilities of, our NLP engine. Our technology is the foundation of what's next in healthcare.
