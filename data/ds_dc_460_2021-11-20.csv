About Us  VIDEO  Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.  You  As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.  The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""  Us  The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.  Your Day  While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:   Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.  Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.  Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.  Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.  Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.   Required Skills / Experiences   Clear and empathetic communicator . You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.  Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods . These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.  Strong programming skills . Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.  Strong exploratory data analysis skills . Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.  Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset.  We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.  At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field . This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

You may also have experience:  Leading a project in which you (and possibly also your team) led a client from the point of analysis to change in behavior - whether internal or external to the organization.  Helping more junior analysts take their work from 80% to done: maybe by quality checking results, adding context, or helping to organize raw analysis into stories and recommendations.  Experience developing solutions that blend data-driven decision-making with thoughtful understanding of human-centered design/processes.  Authoring narrative and data visualizations that were tailored to engage your client at the right level of detail.

The Data Science Manager will provide direct technical oversight to project teams in the use of Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL) technology. TechnoServe projects use a variety of data collection tools that feed data into management information systems based in either CommCare or SalesForce which share data back to various stakeholders through integrations with data visualization tools (primarily Power BI). The Data Science Manager will advise teams on the appropriate use of technology, assist teams in setting up their systems, and consolidate knowledge and best practice for MEL technology. Back-end support to existing technology and data gathering systems (25%): TechnoServe maintains two systems through which projects report the results that the Data Science Manager will oversee. The project status report (PSR) is a quarterly routine through which projects share their progress on field activities. The PSR is based in google sheets and requires some knowledge of scripts to maintain. Corporate Measurement (CM) is an annual routine through which TechnoServe reviews and aggregates impact data from across the portfolio. The Data Science Manager will help manage the reporting process, in part by creating tools and tracking systems.

Experience at distilling clear messages from complex datasets and creating effective storytelling through straightforward, simple and powerful data visualizations. Think  The Economist , not  Information is Beautiful. Capable of using APIs and other backend software to automate data migration between platforms. Preferred Qualifications:  Experience in advanced statistical analysis is a plus with expertise in a statistics package such as SPSS, STATA, or R. Experience with monitoring & evaluation datasets from the international development context. Experience with mobile-based data collection survey tools (CommCare, ODK, Survey CTO, or similar). SalesForce experience is highly preferred, especially with an ability to perform configurations requiring JavaScript. Experience with developing database solutions in AWS or “no-code” platforms such as Knack is a plus. Knowledge, Skills & Abilities:  Strong communication skills are critical. The role will need to manage complex processes and systems and communicate them to non-technical audiences. Listen effectively to understand context and design systems or conduct analysis that responds to the needed insights. Ability to manage multiple projects at once and work independently to prioritize requests. Ability to proactively identify and address complex problems in a way that responds to end user needs. Ability to work independently and remotely while contributing to a team effort. Strong cross-cultural skills; deep respect for and collaborative spirit working with people of all educational, socio-economic, demographic backgrounds, and lifestyles.
