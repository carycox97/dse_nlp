Walmart is the largest retail corporation in the world and the Merchant Tech Data Science team is disrupting and revolutionizing the establishment by being more data driven in their analysis and integrating Machine Learning algorithms to get a more comprehensive understanding of details missed by humans. We extend our reach to 4000 stores across US for testing and deploying sophisticated models of all kinds for every facet or step during the retail supply chain lifecycle. The sophistication afforded by machine learning algorithms allows for more segmentation, which allows for more detailed and descriptive insights. In attempting this, we are also reshaping the attitude of the business towards adopting and trusting AI to be most impactful based on the amount of historical data and investment required. There is a wide gamut of challenges and the obstacles are numerous to shift the thinking between solving for customers’ needs in physical stores versus e-commerce. The challenge of employing ML techniques in retail at such a wide scale, across varied categories of items, presents a great opportunity for creative solutions. The Merch Tech Data Science team tackles this task and it’s problems at multiple fronts. Machine learning algorithms can tell a more complete story to identify anomalies and pinpoint each step of the process along the supply chain. Human bias and guesswork is eliminated, and this is applicable for any stage, be it warehouse processing or vendor management. We work on building stable automated pipelines to take care of these issues. The goals of this team are to generate tangible insights from data collected across multiple channels and to use algorithms and models that can process and learn from these huge datasets to make actionable predictions and recommendations.
