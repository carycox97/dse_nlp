BotGuard provides real-time insight and security for customers fighting account takeover, account creation fraud, payment fraud, and content abuse.  What you will do: Devise experimental and production techniques (supervised, unsupervised, statistical, and rule-based) which leverage the signals we collect from browser and in-app interactions to produce robust ‘bot markers’ for our product. Gain a working understanding of application / account based threat models to best identify analytical approaches that will work. Help the team counter ‘named attacks’, ongoing bot campaigns that we work to eliminate, by understanding how their operators adapt and identifying the weaknesses in their strategies that allow us to keep our markers accurate. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to develop new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, ‘creating tau’ by empowering the other humans around you. Who you are: You’ve worked as a data scientist solving large-scale data intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!). You can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, fraud detection requires identifying anomalies and abuse with minimal ground truth and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how the web works and how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.

Levine Lab Data Types : All of these data will be generated by the Levine lab and provided to the contractor in a pre-processed form. Mouse behavior Body position/location – pose estimation video capture (3 cameras) followed by DeepLabCut or similar Muscle activity – EMG signal from multiple muscles Physical sensors – force transducers, accelerometer etc. Cellular activity (post-hoc): Automated localization analysis and counting of cFos positive cells from spinal cord images Above + analysis of co-localization of cell type specific markers Cellular activity (dynamic): Multi-unit array electrophysiology recordings of the neural activity in dozens to hundreds of units/cells in each animal Above + “opto-tagging” to genetically identify specific units within the broader population of recorded cells Levine Lab Analysis Goals : Data analysis: Integrate data from multiple sources into a multi-dimensional shared space Identify features/components (dimensionality reduction/PCA or similar) Machine learning to identify key features and their relationships to “anchor” data (ex. body position) Comparison of (2b) and (2c) in different biological conditions Recording from different populations of neurons Upon silencing or activation of specific cell types Different behavioral/motivational contexts Developmental age Spinal cord injury Develop a user-friendly interface for internal (our lab) use and data exploration Data Modeling: Physical forces/torques/biomechanics Neural decoding (query relationships and identify correlations between data from behavior and data from ephys) Dynamical systems modeling Long-term basic goal: theory/modeling of neural computations that underlie motor behavior Long-term translational goal: Use these models to predict effective targeted programs of spinal cord electrical stimulation as part of “neuro-rehabilitation” in patients with paralysis or neurodegeneration Levine Lab SOW : Data analysis (as above), including informal consultation on data pre-processing. The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will participate regularly in lab meetings and become an integrated team member The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will develop a user-friendly data commons to facilitate exploration and discovery for members of the lab, spinal cord and motor control researchers, and the larger neuroscience and robotics communities. This could be a part of the STRIDES cloud-based initiative. Levine Lab Background : The mission of our lab is to understand how the central nervous system controls movement, with a focus on the cells and circuits of the spinal cord. We seek to understand (1) the identities of the cell “types” of the spinal cord, (2) how each cell type computes and contributes to specific features of motor behavior, and (3) how these cells are integrated into central nervous system-wide networks for complex movement. We have made exciting progress on our first goal over the past few years (Sathyamurthy and Johnson et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018; Skinnider et al., 2020; and Russ and Patterson et al., 2020). Now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. Ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury. To do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. We will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. We will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. We will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. Finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery. Ward Lab Data Types : Proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics Transcriptomics: whole cell and scRNAseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” RNAseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag Functional genomics: CRISPRi/a pooled screens, perturb-seq Microscopy: Longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), CellProfiler, “exotic” cellpaint Ward Lab Analysis Goals : Majority Effort: The contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets. Minority Effort: Higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets In the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab In the context of larger curated datasets from the community (CRISPRbrain, CZI NCDN, patient genomics, curated scRNAseq datasets) Ward Lab SOW Data analysis (as above) The contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data The contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within DTI to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by DTI The contractor will work with other team members within DTI, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. CZI) Ward Lab   Areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at DTI: Integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that DTI has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at CARD/CZI when possible. Most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by iNDI, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions. Leverage and build upon existing relationships between Ward lab members, CARD, LNG, and DTI. Ward Lab background : The Ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. We exclusively use genetically-modified human iPSCs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. iPSCs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. Almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. Our lab is closely affiliated with the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI), a large-scale NIH initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. We are also a part of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute Neurodegeneration Challenge Network (NDCN), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. Increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. In parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. Results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.",30+ days ago,

About Us  VIDEO  Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.  You  As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.  The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""  Us  The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.  Your Day  While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:   Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.  Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.  Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.  Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.  Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.   Required Skills / Experiences   Clear and empathetic communicator . You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.  Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods . These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.  Strong programming skills . Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.  Strong exploratory data analysis skills . Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.  Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset.  We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.  At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field . This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged. This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.   Desired Skills / Experiences   2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).  Experience with relational databases.  Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.  You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.  Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.   Pivotal is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that will consider all qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity or expression, national origin, genetics, age, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.",30+ days ago,34 reviews

It’s a $12 trillion industry that needs help. Taking the world’s operational efficiency to the next level requires a new era of computing that interconnects legacy systems with new technologies, humans, and objects to provide robust automation and security. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), 5G, Digital Twins, Edge Computing are on the rise, but they are not interoperable with legacy systems or even between themselves. The promise of Industry 4.0, Web 3.0, and Smart Cities cannot be realized on existing siloed technology stacks and data models. The hyper-connected Smart Cities are forestalled by the inability to coordinate physical and digital activities across heterogeneous networks of People, IoT, Robots, Drones, and Autonomous Systems. These networks require real-time communication of context-aware datasets that can be shared across public and private stakeholders and must be simultaneously trustworthy, interoperable, private, and secure. VERSES creates tools and technologies that power the Spatial Web – the vast, private, and secure network that emerges when exponential AI, Robotics, IoT, XR, and 5G converge.

About The Role and Project All of the Federal Marketplace (FMP) and Digital Experience (DX) initiatives require extensive data management, analysis and normalization. FAS has made great strides in the past two years by bringing key data into a FAS Enterprise Data Architecture (EDA) with a data set catalog. In order to bring data into the EDA, data scientists/analysts need to normalize data across multiple systems and sync up data fields to ensure the EDA holds clean, authoritative data that can be used by all of FAS. A good amount of FAS’s data is still held on 30 year old legacy production systems. Often, these data sources do not have similar data elements or the field names are not clear for data consumers. More current data sources such as “prices paid” data are reported in inconsistent formats and are in need of data standards. In order to create unified digital tools for FAS schedule customers, disparate data sources must be painstakingly combined into a unified data structure. Existing data science capabilities within GSA are at or over capacity with demand from across the enterprise. The outcomes of this process will: Increase data quality Enhances data integrity for the Digital Experience (DX) project Provide faster delivery of quality data to customers in support of unpriced services Support TDR expansion and improve the useability and usage of TDR data The Fine Print: Expected travel 0-10%; may increase based on business needs This is an exempt, full-time position Censeo offers a competitive compensation and benefits package, including paid vacation and sick leave, flexible and remote work opportunities, and tuition and training reimbursement.

We are the global leader in bot mitigation. Founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore we’ve grown to protect more than 200 enterprises—including the largest internet platforms—from bot attacks by verifying the humanity of over a trillion (that’s 12 zeroes!) online interactions every day. State-of-the-art bots look and act like humans when they click on ads, visit websites, fill out forms, take over accounts, and commit payment fraud.  We stop them . We hope you’ll want to join our mission to stop bots, disrupt the economics of cyber crime, and keep it human. Detection@HUMANsec The Detection team at HUMAN is the beating heart of our company - finding and stopping bots. We're a group of data professionals and security experts who build the algorithms that run behind the scenes analysing and decisioning on our vast number of daily events. We deploy advanced statistical and machine learning models that need to be flexible for different deployment scenarios and robust to a fraudster’s favourite tactics: evasion and deception.   Countering bot fraud is not a situation where all the interesting data science problems have already been solved. Every week there are brand new challenges that require novel approaches.  - Austin L, Senior Data Scientist, MediaGuard The human we need for this role will work on  MediaGuard : our product for advertising platforms. MediaGuard provides real-time insight for ad-tech customers on which advertising opportunities are fraudulent bot-driven events.  What you'll do: Responsibilities Write ‘bot markers’ which consistently find fraud today, and work with other senior members of the team to develop flexible frameworks that can find the fraud of tomorrow. Become a domain expert in ad-tech and ad-serving, allowing you to develop the best strategies for marker development. Work with engineering managers to scope team OKRs and then deliver your own on time and on-spec. Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientist’s work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy. Collaborate with our product / commercial team to design new data-intensive product features that will delight our customers. Take a prominent role in building data-science toolsets that empower the whole team, especially more junior team members.  Who you are: Background and Skillset You’ve consistently delivered algorithmic software projects that demonstrably solved a business problem well. This means you can explain the nuances of different modelling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use for a given goal, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers. We don’t ask for specific prior domain experience. However, ad-tech work requires learning the intricacies of an infamously complex digital supply chain and cybersecurity work requires a savvy awareness of how bad actors operate. Be prepared to tell us why you think your experience sets you up well. You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms (e.g. Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy etc).Build analysis toolkits and platforms that empower our whole team to work more effectively. You know enough about how the internet/web works to give a rudimentary explanation of DNS / HTTP / JavaScript. You’ve demonstrated that you’re self-driven by learning the skills you need to solve problems you’ve tackled in previous roles. You almost certainly don’t have all the skills to thwart all the bots right now, so an appetite for growth is key.  Our culture and benefits: Helping you do the best work of your life Focus Alongside the feel-good factor of knowing your work each day counters cyber-crime, we designed our cultural norms and work benefits to bring out your best. We strongly value deep work, so we practice company-wide Zoom-free Fridays . This provides a handy backdrop for a related initiative: ‘R&D Research Friday’: half a day each week isolated from day-to-day work for all our people to focus on trying new ideas, personal learning and career development. It’s backed financially too by a generous Learning & Development stipend. HUMAN's company-wide ""no meeting Fridays"" is like a breathe of fresh air after other jobs with the constant context switching of meetings interrupting one's flow. -  Adrian W, Principal Data Engineer.   Flexibility At HUMAN we’re fully committed to flexible working arrangements and making remote work...work. But what does this mean in practice? It means we supply you with a company Macbook Pro and generous home-office stipend, we pay for your mobile and internet bills and we recreate that shared-office-lunching vibe with expensable lunch delivery on Wednesdays.

Preference may be given to candidates who can meet in person in Amherst, MA once/week. BERI is seeking a full-time machine learning software engineer as part of our collaboration with the Autonomous Learning Laboratory at UMass Amherst (https://all.cs.umass.edu/). As the lead developer on the project, this person will have significant independence and autonomy. We’ve secured funding for this position for at least one year, which we believe will be enough time to implement the core functionality. Extensions will depend on our ability to secure more funding during the first year of work. Purpose Prof. Philip Thomas and his collaborators have designed a general and flexible framework for a new kind of machine learning algorithm called a Seldonian algorithm, which clarifies the three-way relationship between ML system designers, users, and the ML systems themselves. In particular, the Seldonian framework simplifies the problem of specifying and regulating undesirable behavior by involving end-users in the specification and oversight of system safety parameters. A high-level description of the Seldonian framework can be found here (http://aisafety.cs.umass.edu/overview.html); the full Science paper can be found here (http://aisafety.cs.umass.edu/paper.html). We want to hire a software developer to create a software library that makes it easier for researchers and practitioners to apply and create Seldonian algorithms. This library would facilitate and advance academic research on safe machine learning and would provide a practical tool for corporations to responsibly apply machine learning to high-risk high-reward applications. The end goal is to get more safety constraints built into ML systems. Responsibilities Plan, design, and code a software library (or set of related libraries) that can be used by other software developers to more easily implement Seldonian algorithms in their projects. Deeply familiarize yourself with the existing literature on Seldonian algorithms Collaborate closely with Prof. Thomas and his collaborators on all aspects of the development process, from the discussion of high-level strategic goals (e.g. what programming language to use) to the design and implementation of individual library features Qualifications 3-7 years of relevant experience Deep knowledge of Python or C++ -----We expect the framework to be developed in Python or C++, and in either case to be callable from other common ML languages. -----However we are open to using other languages, with a priority being placed on modularity and efficiency. Broad familiarity with commonly-used machine learning algorithms Experience leading and owning a software development project from beginning to end Excellent technical communication skills, the ability to elaborate complex technical concepts and collaborate effectively with fellow engineers and researchers Prior research or research engineering experience If you feel you do not meet these qualifications but are still interested in applying, please err on the side of applying anyway. Benefits Become a world-leading expert on the practical implementation of Seldonian algorithms, encouraging the development and deployment of safer ML systems. More independence and autonomy than you’d have at a big tech company Time-off (paid vacation, holidays, sick, bereavement, and parental leave) Platinum health, dental, and vision insurance (98% of employee premiums covered by BERI) Life and short-term/long-term disability insurances (100% of employee premiums covered by BERI) Very flexible work schedule including hours, location, and unpaid vacation policies BERI is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.
